By 2022, the extended reality market is anticipated to be worth $209 billion. Certain diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Schizophrenia, Stroke rehabilitation stimulating specific areas of the patient's brain, healing brain injuries, surgeon training,  realistic 3D visualization, touch-free interfaces, and teaching social skills to  children with autism, have shown promising results with XR-assisted treatments. Similar effects have been used in video game therapies like Akili Interactive's EndeavorRx, which has previously been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment regimen for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, while these improvements have received positive feedback, the field of XR-assisted patient treatment is in its infancy.  The growth of XR in the healthcare sphere has the potential to transform the delivery of medical services. Imagine an elderly patient in a remote setting having a consultation with a world-renowned expert without ever having to leave their house. Rather than operating on cadavers in a medical facility, a surgical  resident does surgery in a virtual setting at home. On the first try, a nurse uses a vein finder to implant an IV. Through cognitive treatment in a virtual world, a war veteran recovers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The paper discusses the potential impact of XR in transforming the healthcare industry, as well as its use cases, challenges, XR tools and techniques for intelligent health care, recent developments of XR in intelligent healthcare services, and the potential benefits and future aspects of XR techniques in the medical domain.",treatment,0.09105466950713957,0
1,"The effect of neurofeedback training combined with computer cognitive games on the time perception, attention, and working memory in children with ADHD.",2022 Aug 24,"Moradi N, Rajabi S, Mansouri Nejad A",Applied neuropsychology. Child,Journal Article,"ADHD, SmartMind, computer cognitive games, neurofeedback, time perception",https://doi.org/10.1080/21622965.2022.2112679,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of neurofeedback (NF) based on quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) and SmartMind game on the time perception, attention, and working memory of children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) through an experimental design. METHOD: Using a purposive sampling method, 32 male students diagnosed with ADHD were selected and then randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group received the treatment (NF + SmartMind) for 30 weekly sessions. Children's performances on a time perception test, a Continuous Performance Test (CPT), and a Wechsler working memory test (WISC) were examined before and after the intervention. RESULTS: A significant difference was observed between the mean scores of the pretest and post-test for the experimental group,  implying that NF training improved short-time perception and long-time perception attention in CPT test: omission error component, Correct Response component, and  working memory: Visual forward component. However, the treatment did not have a significant effect on the commission error component (CPT), working memory in terms of the visual reverse, auditory reverse, and auditory forward components. CONCLUSION: NF combined with computer cognitive games (CCGs) can improve time perception, attention, and working memory in children with ADHD.",treatment,0.42039238830032244,1
2,Effect of game-based high-intensity interval training program on the executive function of children with ADHD: Protocol of a randomized controlled trial.,2022,"Sun F, Chow GC, Yu CC, Ho YF, Liu D, Wong SH, Siu PM, Cooper SB, Jenkins D",PloS one,"Clinical Trial Protocol, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0272121,"BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common developmental disorder in childhood, with a 5%-6% worldwide prevalence. Children  with ADHD often demonstrate impaired executive function, which is closely related to the development of the commonly observed behavioral problems such as inattention, impaired inhibition, and hyperactivity. The purpose of this study is to examine whether a game-based high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program can improve the executive function of children with ADHD, compared with a traditional structured aerobic exercise program and a non-treatment control group. METHODS/DESIGN: A total of 42 children with ADHD will be recruited to participate in this three-arm school-based randomized controlled trial. An 8-week specially designed game-based HIIT (GameHIIT) program and a traditional game-based structured aerobic exercise (GameSAE) program will be delivered to those children randomly assigned to these two intervention groups, while the children in the control group will maintain their regular physical activity over  the same period. A number of outcome measures including executive function, cerebral hemodynamic response, physical activity, physical fitness, and enjoyment and adherence to the intervention will be assessed for both groups at baseline (T0), immediately after the intervention period (T1), and after the follow-up period (T2). DISCUSSION: HIIT has recently emerged as a feasible and efficacious  strategy for increasing physical health outcomes and cognitive function, including executive function, in healthy young people. However, research has yet  to investigate whether the executive function of children with ADHD can be effectively enhanced through HIIT. If, as hypothesized, GameHIIT program improves outcomes for children with ADHD, the present research will inform the development of targeted exercise programs that can be more broadly used with this particular  population.",treatment,0.4643021649009673,1

Early diagnosis and treatment of ADHD is key but may be influenced by the observation and communication skills of caregivers, and the experience of the medical professional. Attempts to obtain additional measures to support the medical diagnosis, such as reaction time when performing a task, can be found in  the literature. We propose an information recording system that allows to study in detail the behavior shown by children already diagnosed with ADHD during a car driving video game. We continuously record the participants' activity throughout  the task and calculate the error committed. Studying the trajectory graphs, some  children showed uniform patterns, others lost attention from one point onwards, and others alternated attention/inattention intervals. Results show a dependence  between the age of the children and their performance. Moreover, by analyzing the positions by age over time using clustering, we show that it is possible to classify children according to their performance. Future studies will examine whether this detailed information about each child's performance pattern can be used to fine-tune treatment.",treatment,0.4190609166282819,1

5,Gender-related differences in involvement of addiction brain networks in internet gaming disorder: Relationships with craving and emotional regulation.,2022 Aug 30,"Wang ZL, Song KR, Zhou N, Potenza MN, Zhang JT, Dong GH",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","*Addiction brain networks, *Craving, *Emotion regulation, *Functional connectivity, *Internet gaming disorder",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2022.110574,"BACKGROUND: Abnormal interactions among addiction brain networks associated with  intoxication, negative affect, and anticipation may have relevance for internet gaming disorder (IGD). Despite prior studies having identified gender-related differences in the neural correlates of IGD, gender-related differences in the involvement of brain networks remain unclear. METHODS: One-hundred-and-nine individuals with IGD (54 males) and 111 with recreational game use (RGU; 58 males) provided resting-state fMRI data. We examined gender-related differences in involvement of addiction brain networks in IGD versus RGU subjects. We further compared the strength between and within addiction brain networks and explored possible relationships between the strength of functional connectivities within and between addiction brain networks and several relevant behavioral measures. RESULTS: The addiction brain networks showed high correct classification rates in distinguishing IGD and RGU subjects in men and women. Male subjects with versus without IGD showed stronger functional connectivities between and within addiction brain networks. Moreover, the strength of the connectivity within the anticipation network in male IGD subjects was positively related to subjective craving. However, female subjects with versus without IGD showed decreased functional connections between and within addiction brain networks. The strength  of connectivity between the anticipation and negative-affect brain networks in female IGD subjects was negatively related to maladaptive cognitive emotion-regulation strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Addiction brain networks have potential for distinguishing IGD and RGU individuals. Importantly, this study identified novel gender-related differences in brain-behavior relationships in IGD. These results help advance current neuroscientific theories of IGD and may inform gender-informed treatment strategies.",treatment,0.2997826462459696,1

ADHD patients exhibit combinations of inattention, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity. With early treatment and diagnosis, there is potential to modify neuronal connections and improve symptoms. However, the heterogeneous nature of ADHD, combined with its comorbidities and a global shortage of diagnostic clinicians, means diagnosis of  ADHD is often delayed. Hence, it is important to consider other pathways to improve the efficiency of early diagnosis, including the role of artificial intelligence. In this study, we reviewed the current literature on machine learning and deep learning studies on ADHD diagnosis and identified the various diagnostic tools used. Subsequently, we categorized these studies according to their diagnostic tool as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), physiological signals, questionnaires, game simulator and performance test, and motion data. We identified research gaps include the paucity of publicly available database for all modalities in ADHD assessment other than MRI, as well as a lack of focus on using data from wearable devices for ADHD diagnosis, such as ECG, PPG, and motion data. We hope that this review will inspire future work to create more publicly available datasets and conduct research for other modes of ADHD diagnosis and monitoring. Ultimately, we hope that artificial intelligence can be extended to multiple ADHD diagnostic tools, allowing for the development of a powerful clinical decision support pathway that can be used both in and out of the hospital.",treatment,0.15707767157991706,0

However, major limitations of earlier studies include small and heterogeneous samples. The current large-scale randomized controlled trial examined effects of calligraphy activity on cognition (including attention), emotions, psychotic symptoms, quality of life, and mood in people with schizophrenia. Methods: One-hundred-and-fifty patients with schizophrenia were randomly allocated to the treatment group (receiving calligraphy activity) or the control group (receiving general activity), both of  which lasted for 24 weeks (70 minutes per session; one session per week). Assessments were conducted at pretest, posttest, and three-month follow-up. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Chu's Attention Test, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, World Health Questionnaire on the Quality of Life-Brief Form, and Visual Analogue Scale were used. Results: Improved cognition and attention were found in both groups, although no group effects were shown. The treatment group appeared to show lower severity of positive symptoms at follow-up than posttest, whereas the control group appeared  to show the opposite pattern. Improved mood was found in the treatment group. Conclusion: This study provides evidence regarding effects of calligraphy activity on increasing cognition and potentially decreasing severity of positive  symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Calligraphy activity can be incorporated in clinical occupational therapy and may be provided to supplement medication treatment.

8,Enhancing neural markers of attention in children with ADHD using a digital therapeutic.,2021,"Gallen CL, Anguera JA, Gerdes MR, Simon AJ, Canadas E, Marco EJ",PloS one,"Clinical Trial, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261981,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental condition characterized by diminished attentional control. Critically, these difficulties are related to negative consequences in real-life functioning both during development and into adulthood. There is now growing evidence that modulating the underlying neural circuits related to attention can improve behavior and brain function in children with ADHD. We have previously shown that  game-based digital therapeutics targeting a key neural marker of attention-midline frontal theta (MFT)-yield positive effects on attentional control in several populations. However, the effects of such digital therapeutics in children with ADHD and no other comorbidities has not been yet examined. To address this gap, we assessed a sample of 25 children with ADHD (8-12 years old)  on neural, behavioral, and clinical metrics of attention before and after a 4-week at-home intervention on an iPad targeting MFT circuitry. We found that children showed enhancements on a neural measure of attention (MFT power), as well as on objective behavioral measures of attention and parent reports of clinical ADHD symptoms. Importantly, we observed relationships between the neural and behavioral cognitive improvements, demonstrating that those children who showed the largest intervention-related neural gains were also those that improved the most on the behavioral tasks indexing attention. These findings provide support for using targeted, digital therapeutics to enhance multiple features of attentional control in children with ADHD.

Understanding the association may help develop policies and interventions targeting specific screen activities to promote healthful screen use and mental health in children and youth. Objective: To determine whether specific forms of screen use (television [TV] or digital media, video games, electronic learning, and video-chatting time) were associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety, conduct problems, irritability, hyperactivity, and inattention in children and youth during COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: A longitudinal cohort study with repeated measures of exposures and outcomes was conducted in children  and youth aged 2 to 18 years in Ontario, Canada, between May 2020 and April 2021  across 4 cohorts of children or youth: 2 community cohorts and 2 clinically referred cohorts. Parents were asked to complete repeated questionnaires about their children's health behaviors and mental health symptoms during COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: The exposure variables were children's daily TV or digital media time, video game time, electronic-learning time, and video-chatting time. The mental health outcomes were parent-reported symptoms of child depression, anxiety, conduct problems and irritability, and hyperactivity/inattention using validated standardized tools. Results: This study included 2026 children with 6648 observations. In younger children (mean [SD] age, 5.9 [2.5] years; 275 male participants [51.7%]), higher TV or digital media  time was associated with higher levels of conduct problems (age 2-4 years: beta,  0.22 [95% CI, 0.10-0.35]; P < .001; age >/=4 years: beta, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.02-0.11]; P = .007) and hyperactivity/inattention (beta, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.006-0.14]; P = .04). In older children and youth (mean [SD] age, 11.3 [3.3] years; 844 male participants [56.5%]), higher levels of TV or digital media time  were associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and inattention; higher levels of video game time were associated with higher levels of depression, irritability, inattention, and hyperactivity. Higher levels of electronic learning time were associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, higher levels of screen use were associated poor mental health of children and youth during the COVID-19  pandemic. These findings suggest that policy intervention as well as evidence-informed social supports are needed to promote healthful screen use and  mental health in children and youth during the pandemic and beyond.",treatment,0.37464374136342704,1

A serious game coupled with a classroom session led by lived experience workers (LEWs) might help to overcome these barriers. The school-based Strong Teens and Resilient Minds (STORM) preventive program employed this strategy and offered a serious game, Moving Stories. The current study was carried out to assess inhibiting and promoting factors for scaling up Moving Stories once its effectiveness has been ascertained. METHODS: Moving Stories was offered in three steps: (1) introductory classroom session, (2) students playing the game for five days, (3) debriefing classroom session led by lived experience worker. Data was collected on the number of participating students, costs of offering Moving Stories, and was further based on the notes of the debriefing sessions to check if mental health first aid (MHFA) strategies were addressed. RESULTS: Moving Stories was offered in seven high-schools. Coverage was moderate with 982 participating students out  of 1880 (52%). Most participating students (83%) played the Moving Stories app three out of the five days. Qualitative data showed that the MHFAs were discussed in all debriefing sessions. Students showed great interest in lived experience workers' stories and shared their own experiences with depression. CONCLUSIONS: Bringing Moving Stories to scale in the high-school setting appears feasible, but will remain logistically somewhat challenging. Future implementation and scale-up of Moving Stories could benefit from improved selection and training of LEWs that played such an important role in grabbing the full attention of students and were able to launch frank discussions about depressive disorder and stigma in classrooms.

DESIGN AND METHODS: A qualitative study based on genogram was conducted. Seven pairs of parents completed their genogram and a semi-structured interview. Two related donors were interviewed to  discuss their experiences in the decision-making process of donating bone marrow  to their loved ones. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. RESULTS: The genogram presents the complete family structure, family member relationships and incident-related conflicts. Two superordinate themes emerged from the data analysis. The first theme was transplantation decision motivations, including four subthemes: the values of life priority, empathy based on kinship, inheritance of family blood, trust in doctors and medical science. The second theme was transplantation decision conflicts, including four subthemes: decision-making conflicts among family members, related-donor decision-making conflicts, risk-benefit game, blind optimism and insufficient cognition conflict. CONCLUSIONS: Genogram can show the  hidden resources and conflicts of each family and help the care providers better  understand parents' experience and the decision-making dilemmas in the decision-making process for children with haematological diseases receiving HSCT. The needs of transplant families for treatment-related information were not fully met. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: It is necessary for medical staff to increase psychological and informational support for donors and their families when the parents of patients make bone marrow transplant decisions. Medical staff should engage in family-focused systematic interventions to reduce the psychological burden and conflicts of decision makers.",treatment,0.0748610951174574,0

However, social robots may help to  improve children's motivation and to propose enjoyable and tailored activities. Here, we have used the Co-writer scenario in which a child is asked to teach a robot how to write via demonstration on a tablet, combined with a series of games we developed to train specifically pressure, tilt, speed, and letter liaison controls. This setup was proposed to a 10-year-old boy with a complex neurodevelopmental disorder combining phonological disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia, and developmental coordination disorder with severe dysgraphia. Writing impairments were severe and limited his participation in classroom activities despite 2 years of specific support in school and professional speech and motor remediation. We implemented the setup during his occupational therapy for 20 consecutive weekly sessions. We found that his motivation was restored; avoidance behaviors disappeared both during sessions and at school; handwriting quality and posture improved dramatically. In conclusion, treating dysgraphia using child-robot interaction is feasible and improves writing.

One of the strongest associations has  been with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). We present a systematic review of this association by pooling and integrating available evidence. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, PsychInfo and CINHAHL were searched for articles that reported a quantitative association between GD and ADHD and its dimensions, using equivalent search terms. Quality appraisal was done using criteria adapted from the Critical Appraisal Skills Package (CASP) checklists. RESULTS: 1028 articles were identified, of which 29 studies were included for systematic review (n = 56650 participants). Most of these studies were observational in nature, and were of moderate quality, with deficits particularly in the domains of generalisability and confounding. Community surveys (n = 18) of purposive samples constituted the majority, with fewer clinic-based samples (n =  11). While ADHD symptoms were consistently associated with GD, More frequent associations were displayed with inattention associations with GD than other ADHD subscales. There were no conclusive findings regarding the type of game on severity of either condition, or on completion of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest an association between ADHD and GD, although the direction of the relationship is unclear. This has implications for clinical practice, policy  and research. We recommend that ADHD is screened for when evaluating IGD as part  of routine practice.""",treatment,0.38794046522339937,1

Digital health,"Journal Article, Randomized Controlled Trial, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,https://doi.org/10.1016/S2589-7500(20)30017-0,"BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common paediatric neurodevelopmental disorder with substantial effect on families and society. Alternatives to traditional care, including novel digital therapeutics,  have shown promise to remediate cognitive deficits associated with this disorder  and may address barriers to standard therapies, such as pharmacological interventions and behavioural therapy. AKL-T01 is an investigational digital therapeutic designed to target attention and cognitive control delivered through  a video game-like interface via at-home play for 25 min per day, 5 days per week  for 4 weeks. This study aimed to assess whether AKL-T01 improved attentional performance in paediatric patients with ADHD. METHODS: The Software Treatment for Actively Reducing Severity of ADHD (STARS-ADHD) was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled trial of paediatric patients (aged 8-12 years, without disorder-related medications) with confirmed ADHD and Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) Attention Performance Index (API) scores of -1.8 and below done  by 20 research institutions in the USA. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to AKL-T01 or a digital control intervention. The primary outcome was mean change in TOVA API from pre-intervention to post-intervention. Safety, tolerability, and compliance were also assessed. Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02674633 and is  completed. FINDINGS: Between July 15, 2016, and Nov 30, 2017, 857 patients were evaluated and 348 were randomly assigned to receive AKL-T01 or control. Among patients who received AKL-T01 (n=180 [52%]; mean [SD] age, 9.7 [1.3] years) or control (n=168 [48%]; mean [SD] age, 9.6 [1.3] years), the non-parametric estimate of the population median change from baseline TOVA API was 0.88 (95% CI  0.24-1.49; p=0.0060). The mean (SD) change from baseline on the TOVA API was 0.93 (3.15) in the AKL-T01 group and 0.03 (3.16) in the control group. There were no serious adverse events or discontinuations. Treatment-related adverse events were mild and included frustration (5 [3%] of 180) and headache (3 [2%] of 180). Patient compliance was a mean of 83 (83%) of 100 expected sessions played (SD, 29.2 sessions). INTERPRETATION: Although future research is needed for this digital intervention, this study provides evidence that AKL-T01 might be used to  improve objectively measured inattention in paediatric patients with ADHD, while  presenting minimal adverse events.

Children with VIs have been shown to have a poorer self-concept and lower general psychosocial well-being compared with peers without VIs. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a serious game to improve psychosocial outcomes in children with VIs. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the computer game See for children with VIs. The game was developed based on rational-emotive behavioral therapy principles, with the aim of addressing self-concept (academic, social, and general), psychosocial well-being (social inclusion, exclusion, and emotions), and coping strategies (approach, avoidance). Sixty-four children aged  6-8 years were randomized to the intervention group, who played the game, or a control group, who received care-as-usual (CAU). RESULTS: Our results showed that children with VIs who played the serious game scored significantly higher on academic self-concept and social inclusion compared with the control group. Furthermore, children rated the game positively, suggesting the desirability, validity, and feasibility of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide preliminary evidence that a serious game can enhance psychosocial outcomes in children with VIs.

We aimed to clarify if there  is a typical AN family profile and if the LTPc procedure could predict the risk of developing AN. We confirmed that AN families exhibit dysfunctional alliances.  Particularly because of the difficulty of the three members to be available to the interaction at least with their body (participation) and to comply with the role expected at each stage of the game (organization). Moreover, these families  show a significant worse functioning, especially regards to the mother-daughter phase of the game, in focal attention and affective contact functional levels, while in triadic and couple phases they present lower scores than comparison group in all functional levels. Furthermore, we found that LTPc may predict the possibility of belonging to a family with a daughter with AN rather than one whose daughter has a different disorder. Therefore, LTPc would allow clinicians foresee the risk of developing AN and tailoring the most suitable therapeutic intervention and finally see its effectiveness using LTPc for later follow-up video feedback sessions.",treatment,0.07452282934131736,0

To this purpose, we have designed two embodied mirroring setups using the NAO humanoid robot. Two different tracking systems were used and compared: Inertial Measurement Units and the Microsoft Kinect, a marker-less vision based system. Both platforms were able to mirror upper limb basic movements of two healthy subjects, an adult and a child. However, despite the lower accuracy, the Kinect-based setup was chosen as the best candidate for embodied mirroring in autism treatment, thanks to the lower intrusiveness and reduced setup time.

Maternal PTSD may not only have a significant negative impact on mother-infant interactions, but also on long-term infant development. The partner's mental health may also affect infant development. Evidence-based early interventions to  prevent the development of postpartum PTSD in mothers are lacking. Immediately after a traumatic event, memory formation is vulnerable to interference. There is accumulating evidence that a brief behavioural intervention including a visuospatial task may result in a reduction in intrusive memories of the trauma.

The goal  of this study was to investigate reward delay impulsivity in children with LOC-E, ADHD, or a double diagnosis, in contrast to healthy children. Children (8 to 13 years) with LOC-E (n = 24), ADHD (n = 33), a double diagnosis (n = 9), and healthy children (n = 34) performed a computer game (door opening task [DOT]) and the delay of gratification task (DoGT) to assess food related facets of reward delay impulsivity. In addition, children reported whether they worried to lose control over eating during the DoGT. There were no group differences in the DOT.  However, children with ADHD or a double diagnosis had a significantly higher risk to eat prematurely during the DoGT than children with LOC-E, who were not significantly different from healthy children. Children with a double diagnosis were most likely to worry about losing control over eating during the DoGT, followed by children with LOC-E, and both had a significantly higher probability  to worry than healthy children. For children with a double diagnosis the probability to worry was significantly higher than for children with ADHD. If replicated, these findings point to a special relevance of reward delay impulsivity in children with ADHD or a double diagnosis, compared to children with LOC-E.

However, studies investigating the effect of ABMT in the context of CBT have yielded mixed results. Here, we propose an enhanced ABMT to target the attentional bias towards threat, in addition to classic CBT for anxiety disorders in youth. This enhanced  ABMT integrates the modified dot-probe task used in previous studies, where a target is always presented at the previous location of the neutral and not the simultaneously presented threatening stimulus, with a visual search, where the targets are always presented distally of threatening distractors. These two training elements (modified dot-probe and visual search) are embedded in an engaging game to foster motivation and adherence. Our goal is to determine the efficacy of the enhanced ABMT in the context of CBT. Further, we aim to replicate two previous findings: (a) aberrant amygdala connectivity being the neurobiological correlate of the attentional bias towards threat at baseline; and (b) amygdala connectivity being a mediator of the ABMT effect. We will also explore moderators of treatment response (age, sex, depressive symptoms and irritability) on a behavioral and neuronal level. METHODS: One hundred and twenty youth (8-17 years old) with a primary anxiety disorder diagnosis all receive CBT  and are randomized to nine weeks of either active or control ABMT and symptom improvement will be compared between the two study arms. We will also recruit 60  healthy comparison youth, who along with eligible anxious youth, will be assessed with the dot-probe task during fMRI (anxious youth: before and after training; healthy volunteers: second measurement twelve weeks after initial assessment). DISCUSSION: The present study will contribute to the literature by (1) potentially replicating that aberrant amygdala connectivity mediates the attentional bias towards threat in anxious youth; (2) determining the efficacy of enhanced ABMT; and (3) advancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying ABMT.

Slower motor development is evident in early childhood in this population, making early motor skills intervention advisable. As educational games and modern technology can represent new forms of  treatment, this study evaluated four Kinect-based visuo-motor games called Fruits that were specially designed for this research. We sought to test whether children with ASD would show behavior changes during their game play and whether  any effects would generalize to another game called Rackets. The study included 10 elementary school children with ASD, aged 9-13 years, who were divided into (a) an experimental group (n = 5) who, in addition to standard treatment, played  Fruits once a week for a 5-week period and Rackets both before and after the 5-week period and (b) a control group (n = 5) who received only standard treatment during this period and also played Rackets before and after it. We found significant improvements in gross motor skills and successful generalization of acquired skills among children in the experimental group relative to the control group. The experimental group also showed an increase in  positive emotions and a decrease in loss of attention while playing the games. These preliminary findings indicate a motor skill benefit for children with ASD who play Kinect-based educational games, but further research is needed to replicate and expand these findings with larger participant samples.",treatment,0.49918672270842934,1

RECOGNeyes is a computer game that is played using the eyes as the game controller. The rationale behind the game is that individuals with ADHD have an underdeveloped attention control system. This attention control system is underdeveloped not because they  lack this capacity but because this ability has not been sufficiently developed.  The game was designed as an intervention for training visual attention in ADHD. METHODS: The sample included 28 children aged 8-15 years (18 aged < 12 y and 10 aged >/= 12 y) previously diagnosed with ADHD (DSM-5 criteria). The participants  were randomly divided into 2 groups. The experimental group played RECOGNeyes with eye-tracker for 3 weeks (3 times/week) at home, while the control group played the game using the mouse. Different attentional parameters were assessed before and after training. The study was conducted from January 2018-June 2018. RESULTS: Participants from the eye-tracker group showed an improvement posttest compared to pretest in impulsivity (P = .0067), reaction time (P < .0001), and fixation gaze control (P < .0001). No changes were found in mouse control between pretest and posttest assessments. CONCLUSION: RECOGNeyes is a child-friendly, interactive game combined with eye-tracking technology that seems to provide an improvement in the visual attention system, which is especially indicated for ADHD patients. This game might be used as an alternative to pharmacologic therapy and may provide new insights into the treatment of ADHD..",treatment,0.46495710502072773,1

Despite the increasing body of research on this cognitive deficit, set-shifting training has  not been exclusively studied in ASD. AIMS: In this study, a training condition [set-shifting improvement tasks (SSIT)] was developed to improve set-shifting ability; afterwards, the possible effects of these tasks were investigated. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: With the aim of improving set-shifting ability in children with autism, a training program (SSIT), involving a computer game (Tatka, a puzzle game produced by our research team) with some home-based tasks (for generalisation purposes), was developed. Then, in a quasi-experimental design, the effects of SSIT tasks were studied on children (n = 13, 5-7 years old) with high-functioning autism. Outcome measures (pre-training, post-training  and a 6-week follow-up) were assessed using Modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Bender-Gestalt Test and Behavioural Flexibility Rating Scale. RESULTS AND OUTCOMES: A significant change was observed in both cognitive (Bender Gestalt, eta p 2 = 0.84 ; WCST; = p 2 0.87 ) and behavioural flexibilities ( eta p 2 = 0.79 ) and also in repetitive behaviours ( eta p 2 = 0.45 ). Furthermore, the result remained stable to some extent for about 1 month after the training condition. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Developing the SSIT is just an initial step in the major target of creating cognitive rehabilitation tools to be used by clinicians and parents for children diagnosed with ASD and should be understood as a supplement, rather than an alternative, to the main treatments such as applied behaviour analysis. Future research with larger samples are needed to confirm whether this intervention is effective for children with ASD.",treatment,0.18373589359742054,1

Objective: Internet Gaming and Internet Use Disorder (IGD and IUD) have gained increasing attention in the scientific community over the last few years.  The inclusion of ""Gaming Disorder"" in the ICD-11 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems) promoted the need for evidence-based and effective treatments. PROTECT+ is such a cognitive-behavioral  group therapy program for adolescents with IGD and IUD. The present study evaluates the medium-term effects after 4 months. Method: N = 54 patients, aged 9 to 19 years (M = 13.48, SD = 1.72), participated in the early intervention study  between April 2016 and December 2017 in Heidelberg, Germany. Symptom severity was assessed at baseline, at the end of the treatment, and at 4-month follow-up using standardized diagnostic tools. Results: Multilevel analyses showed a significant  reduction in symptom severity using the Video Game Dependency Scale (CSAS) at 4-month follow-up. We found a small effect size in self-reported reduction of symptom severity (d = 0.35) and a moderate effect size in parental ratings (d = 0.77). The Reliable Change Index measured by the Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS) indicated a high heterogeneity in individual symptom changes over time. Patients showed high satisfaction regarding the treatment program at 1- und 4-month follow-up. Conclusions: This study is internationally one of the few to show a significant reduction of IGD and IUD symptoms after 4 months.",treatment,0.47451491248272687,1

However, little is known about brain network organizational changes underlying behavior improvement following BCI-based training. To cover this gap, we aimed to examine the topological alterations of large-scale brain functional networks induced by the 8-week BCI-based attention intervention in ADHD boys using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging method. Compared to the non-intervention (ADHD-NI) group, the intervention group (ADHD-I) showed greater reduction of inattention symptoms accompanied with differential brain network reorganizations after training. Specifically, the ADHD-NI group had increased functional connectivity (FC) within the salience/ventral attention network (SVN) and increased FC between task-positive networks (including the SVN, dorsal attention (DAN), somatomotor, and executive control network) and subcortical regions; in contrast ADHD-I group  did not have this pattern. In parallel, ADHD-I group had reduced degree centrality and clustering coefficient as well as increased closeness in task-positive and the default mode networks (prefrontal regions) after the training. More importantly, these reduced local functional processing mainly in the SVN were associated with less inattentive/internalizing problems after 8-week BCI-based intervention across ADHD patients. Our findings suggest that the BCI-based attention training facilitates behavioral improvement in ADHD children  by reorganizing brain functional network from more regular to more random configurations, particularly renormalizing salience network processing.

Similarly, fast re-orienting saccadic eye movements are also inaccurate and more variable in both endpoint and timing. Atypical gaze and attention are among the earliest symptoms observed in ASD. Disruption of these foundation skills critically affects the development of higher level cognitive and social behavior. We propose that interventions aimed at these early deficits  that support social and cognitive skills will be broadly effective. We conducted  a pilot clinical trial designed to demonstrate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of using gaze-contingent video games for low-cost in-home training of attention and eye movement. Eight adolescents with ASD participated in an 8-week  training, with pre-, mid- and post-testing of eye movement and attention control. Six of the eight adolescents completed the 8 weeks of training and all six showed improvement in attention (orienting, disengagement) and eye movement control or both. All game systems remained intact for the duration of training and all participants could use the system independently. We delivered a robust, low-cost, gaze-contingent game system for home use that, in our pilot training sample, improved the attention orienting and eye movement performance of adolescent participants in 8 weeks of training.

This paper presents the key developments of our ongoing effort to design an interactive rehabilitation environment that motivates physically impaired children throughout their therapy. The continuous motivation is achieved by the system adapting fundamental therapeutic components to the performance of each child. The relevant movement is mirrored to an animated character projected in front of the child. We speculate that the visual observation of one's own movements will activate the ""mirror neuron system"", a brain system underlying the human capacity to learn by imitation. Our rehabilitation algorithm personalizes the difficulty of the tasks by adapting the difficulty of reaching virtual targets on the animated environment through changing the visual gain between real and animated movements. To track the sensorimotor performance, we estimated the time required to reach a target. To give a proof of concept for the adaptation of the visual gain, we developed a serious game driven by a Leap Motion device. In addition to becoming a testbed for studying sensorimotor integration and neuroplasticity, the proposed notion of visual gain can be integrated into a highly engaging environment in which physically impaired children will play their way to recovery.",treatment,0.09987117111929986,0

The study consisted of a 2 (medication: methylphenidate, placebo) x 2 (sports training: instruction and practice, recreational play) between-groups design and was conducted over a 3-week period during the STP. Sports training was conducted with a novel sport, badminton, to limit previous sport knowledge and to differentiate it from concurrent sports training that occurred within the STP. Objective and subjective measures of sports skills, knowledge, and behavior were collected. Results indicated that, relative to recreational play, brief sports training improved observed and counselor-rated measures of sports competence including sports skills, knowledge, game awareness, effort, frustration, and enjoyment. During sports training, medication incrementally improved children's observed rule following behavior and counselor-rated sportsmanship relative to placebo. In the absence of sports training, medication improved behavior, effort, and sport knowledge. Training in  sports skills and rules produced the largest magnitude effects on sports-related  outcomes. Therefore, skills training, rather than medication alone, should be used in conjunction with behavioral intervention to teach sports to youth with ADHD.

This study aimed to investigate frontal inhibitory function objectively in children with AD/HD during ""rock, paper, scissors"" (RPS) tasks, as a familiar game for Japanese children, using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eighteen children  with AD/HD were compared with 27 typically developing children (TDC). Children from each group were divided into two age groups: younger, 6-10years; and older,  11-16years. Changes in oxygenated hemoglobin [oxy-Hb] were measured in the prefrontal region using NIRS during a 'to lose' RPS task, in which subjects were  asked to present the RPS signal that would lose in response to one of the three signals displayed randomly on a computer screen every 2.0s. RESULTS: The rate of  correct performance with both TDC and AD/HD increased with age. Only in the older group, the rate of correct performance was significantly higher with TDC than with AD/HD. However, children with AD/HD in both age groups showed significantly  lower [oxy-Hb] activity in the prefrontal region during the 'to lose' RPS task, particularly in the dorsolateral area. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that prefrontal region activation during the 'to lose' RPS task could offer a biomarker for diagnosing AD/HD, and may help in the early treatment of AD/HD.",treatment,0.19991147512666974,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The game was tested in  a Dutch sample (N = 73) of school-aged children with elevated ADHD symptoms. Children assigned to the intervention condition played ""Adventurous Dreaming Highflying Dragon,"" and those in the control condition played a comparable full-body-driven game without ADHD-focused training components. Games were played during six 15-minute sessions. Outcomes were teacher-rated ADHD symptoms and scores on neuropsychological tasks assessing motor skills, impulsivity, and sustained attention. RESULTS: There was some indication of greater improvement in the intervention group in comparison to the control group in terms of teacher-rated ADHD symptoms. Both groups showed equal indication of improvement in fine motor skills, but no change was found in gross motor skills. Additionally, both groups showed a deterioration in number of hits (assessing sustained attention) on the go/no-go task. Last, the intervention group showed a  greater increase in false alarms (assessing impulsivity) than the control group.  CONCLUSION: Dragon seems promising as a game-based intervention for children with ADHD. Children who played Dragon improved in several areas with only a short amount of gameplay (1.5 hours in total), and their satisfaction with the game was high. For future research, it is recommended to further inspect Dragon's influence on impulsivity and gross motor skills. Furthermore, it is recommended to disentangle, examine, and evaluate specific properties of videogames that might lead to positive behavioral change.",treatment,0.3139034431137725,1

In addition to game play, the intervention incorporates metacognitive strategies provided by trained educational assistants  (EAs), to facilitate generalization and far transfer to academic and daily skills. EAs delivered the intervention to children (ages 6-13) during their regular school day, providing children with instruction in metacognitive strategies to improve game play, with participants completing approximately 12 hours of training over an 8 to 12 school week period. Pre- and post-test analyses revealed significant improvement on measures of working memory and attention, including reduced distractibility and improved divided attention skills. Additionally, children showed significant gains in performance on an academic measure of reading fluency, suggesting that training-related gains in attention and working memory transferred to classroom performance. Exit interviews with EAs revealed that the intervention was easily delivered within the school day, that children enjoyed the intervention, and that children transferred metacognitive strategies learned in game play into the classroom.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the effects of Plan-It Commander on daily life skills of children with ADHD in a multisite randomized controlled crossover open-label trial. METHODS: Participants (N=170) in this 20-week trial had a diagnosis of ADHD and ranged in age from 8 to 12 years (male: 80.6%, 137/170; female: 19.4%, 33/170). They were randomized to a serious game intervention group (group 1; n=88) or a treatment-as-usual crossover group (group 2; n=82). Participants randomized to group 1 received a serious game intervention in addition to treatment as usual for the first 10 weeks and then received treatment as usual for the next 10 weeks. Participants randomized to group 2 received treatment as usual for the first 10 weeks and crossed over to the serious game intervention in addition to treatment as usual for the subsequent 10 weeks. Primary (parent report) and secondary (parent, teacher, and child self-report) outcome measures were administered at baseline, 10 weeks, and 10-week follow-up. RESULTS: After 10 weeks, participants in group 1 compared to group 2 achieved significantly greater improvements on the primary outcome of time management skills (parent-reported; P=.004) and on secondary outcomes of the social skill of responsibility (parent-reported; P=.04), and working memory (parent-reported; P=.02). Parents and teachers reported that total social skills improved over time within groups,  whereas effects on total social skills and teacher-reported planning/organizing skills were nonsignificant between groups. Within group 1, positive effects were  maintained or further improved in the last 10 weeks of the study. Participants in group 2, who played the serious game during the second period of the study (weeks 10 to 20), improved on comparable domains of daily life functioning over time.

To address this issue, a clinical assessment tool (C-VAT 2.0) was developed and tested in a clinical setting. The instrument allows exploration of the validity of the DSM-5 proposal for 'internet gaming disorder'. METHOD: Using C-VAT 2.0, the current study provides a sensitivity analysis of the proposed DSM-5 criteria  in a clinical youth sample (13-23years old) in treatment for video gaming disorder (N=32). The study also explores the clinical characteristics of these patients. RESULTS: The patients were all male and reported spending extensive amounts of time on video games. At least half of the patients reported playing online games (n=15). Comorbid problems were common (n=22) and included (social) anxiety disorders, PDD NOS, ADHD/ADD, Parent-Child relationship problem, and various types of depressive mood problems. The sensitivity of the test was good:  results further show that the C-VAT correctly identified 91% of the sample at the proposed cut-off score of at least 5 out of 9 of the criteria. As our study did not include healthy, extreme gamers, we could not assess the specificity of the tool: future research should make this a priority. CONCLUSION: Using the proposed DSM-5 cut-off score, the C-VAT 2.0 shows preliminary validity in a sample of gamers in treatment for gaming disorder, but the discriminating value of the instrument should be studied further. In the meantime, it is crucial that therapists try to avoid false positives by using expert judgment of functional impairment in each case.",treatment,0.7136220347766006,1

GoFAR is a novel, 3-part intervention designed to improve self-regulation and adaptive living skills of children with FASD by improving metacognitive control of emotions and arousal. METHODS: The intervention has 3 components: (i) GoFAR: a ""serious game"" designed to teach a metacognitive control strategy in a computer game environment; (ii) parent training on child behavioral regulation; and (iii)  Behavior Analog Therapy (BAT) sessions, a practical application of the metacognitive learning methodology by parent and child in the context of learning adaptive skills. The learning strategy (FAR) teaches the child to Focus and make  a plan, Act out the plan, and Reflect back on the plan. Thirty families were randomized to 3 groups: (i) GoFAR (n = 10); (ii) FACELAND (n = 10); or (iii) CONTROL (n = 10). The 2 intervention groups, GoFAR and FACELAND, used computer games to instruct children. Both groups also received 5 sessions of parent training followed by 5 sessions of joint parent/child therapy (BAT). Assessment of disruptive behavior, including frequency of temper tantrums, frustration tolerance, impulsivity, destructiveness, aggression, and maintaining attention were carried out before enrollment at Mid-Treatment, when game play and parent training were completed, and finally, after completing the BAT sessions. RESULTS: Parental report of disruptive behavior overall was significantly reduced in the GoFAR group after the first components, game play and parent training, and after  the BAT sessions in the FACELAND group with no changes in the CONTROL group over  time. CONCLUSIONS: The GoFAR((R)) game was well received by children and effective in teaching the required skills. Mastering the FAR metacognitive strategy was associated with a reduction in disruptive behaviors in children with FASD suggesting that effective interventions can improve outcomes for this high-risk group.",treatment,0.38013876093965915,1

Theory suggests that this is due to an elevated sensitivity of basic  threat circuitry implicated in retaliation (amygdala/periaqueductal gray) in youths with DBD and low levels of callous-unemotional traits and dysfunctional regulatory activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in youths with DBD irrespective of callous-unemotional traits. METHOD: A total of 56 youths 10-18 years of age (23 of them female) participated in the study: 30 youths with DBD, divided by median split into groups with high and low levels of callous-unemotional traits, and 26 healthy youths. All participants completed an  ultimatum game task during functional MRI. RESULTS: Relative to the other groups, youths with DBD and low levels of callous-unemotional traits showed greater increases in activation of basic threat circuitry when punishing others and dysfunctional down-regulation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex during retaliation. Relative to healthy youths, all youths with DBD showed reduced amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex connectivity during high provocation. Ventromedial prefrontal cortex responsiveness and ventromedial prefrontal cortex-amygdala connectivity were related to patients' retaliatory propensity (behavioral responses during the task) and parent-reported reactive aggression. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest differences in the underlying neurobiology of maladaptive reactive aggression in youths with DBD who have relatively low levels of callous-unemotional traits. Youths with DBD and low callous-unemotional traits alone showed significantly greater threat responses during retaliation relative to comparison subjects. These data also suggest that ventromedial prefrontal cortex-amygdala connectivity is critical for regulating retaliation/reactive aggression and, when dysfunctional, contributes to reactive aggression, independent of level of callous-unemotional traits.",treatment,0.024840943113772454,0

Unfortunately, gamified training programs currently available for ADHD have been limited in their ability to demonstrate in-game behavior skills that generalize to daily life situations. Therefore, we developed a new serious game (called ""Plan-It Commander"") that was specifically designed to promote behavioral learning and promotes strategy use in domains of daily life functioning such as time management, planning/organizing, and prosocial skills that are known to be problematic for children with ADHD.

Generally, these interventions focus on training a single cognitive domain (e.g., working memory [WM], inhibition, or cognitive-flexibility). However, evidence suggests that most children with ADHD show deficits on multiple EFs, and that these EFs are largely  related to different brain regions. Therefore, training multiple EFs might be a potentially more effective strategy to reduce EF-related ADHD symptoms. METHODS:  Eighty-nine children with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD (aged 8-12) were randomized to either a full-active-condition where visuospatial WM, inhibition and cognitive-flexibility were trained, a partially-active-condition where inhibition and cognitive-flexibility were trained and the WM-training task was presented in placebo-mode, or to a full placebo-condition. Short-term and long-term (3-months) effects of this gamified, 25-session, home-based computer-training were evaluated on multiple outcome domains. RESULTS: During training compliance was high (only 3% failed to meet compliance criteria). After  training, only children in the full-active condition showed improvement on measures of visuospatial short-term-memory (STM) and WM. Inhibitory performance and interference control only improved in the full-active- and the partially-active condition. No Treatment-condition x Time interactions were found for cognitive-flexibility, verbal WM, complex-reasoning, nor for any parent-, teacher-, or child-rated ADHD behaviors, EF-behaviors, motivational behaviors, or general problem behaviors. Nonetheless, almost all measures showed main Time-effects, including the teacher-ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements on inhibition and visuospatial STM and WM were specifically related to the type of treatment received. However, transfer to untrained EFs and behaviors was mostly nonspecific (i.e., only interference control improved exclusively in the two EF training conditions). As such, in this multiple EF-training, mainly nonspecific treatment factors - as opposed to the specific effects of training EFs-seem related to far transfer effects found on EF and behavior.

There is an urgent need for effective interventions, but  in spite of the increasing research focus on computerized cognitive training, this has not been studied in ASD. Hence, we investigated two EF training conditions in children with ASD. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, children with ASD (n = 121, 8-12 years, IQ > 80) were randomly assigned to an adaptive working memory (WM) training, an adaptive cognitive flexibility-training, or a non-adaptive control training (mock-training). Braingame Brian, a computerized EF-training with game-elements, was used. Outcome measures (pretraining, post-training, and 6-week-follow-up) were near-transfer to trained EFs, far-transfer to other EFs (sustained attention and inhibition), and  parent's ratings of daily life EFs, social behavior, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-behavior, and quality of life. RESULTS: Attrition-rate was 26%. Children in all conditions who completed the training improved in WM, cognitive flexibility, attention, and on parent's ratings, but not in inhibition. There were no significant differential intervention effects, although children in the WM condition showed a trend toward improvement on near-transfer WM and ADHD-behavior, and children in the cognitive flexibility condition showed a trend toward improvement on near-transfer flexibility. CONCLUSION: Although children in the WM condition tended to improve more in WM and ADHD-behavior, the lack of differential improvement on most outcome measures, the absence of a clear effect of the adaptive training compared to the mock-training, and the high attrition rate suggest that the training in its present form is probably not suitable for children with ASD.",treatment,0.26349824389682175,1

Neurofeedback interventions have reduced symptoms in children with ASD by self-regulation of brain rhythms. However, cortical deficiencies are not the only cause of these symptoms. Peripheral physiological activity, such as the heart rate and its variability, is closely linked to neurophysiological signals and associated with social engagement. Therefore, a combined approach targeting the interplay between brain, body, and behavior could be more effective. Brain-computer interface applications for combined neurofeedback and biofeedback  treatment for children with ASD are currently nonexistent.

We further investigated if cognitive capacity and motor impairment influenced game performance. Nineteen children with neurological gait disorders (mean age: 13.4 y, 42% girls) participated. To quantify game participation, electromyographic muscle activity (M. rectus femoris) and heart rate were compared in a demanding part and a less demanding part of the game. Cognitive capacity was assessed with the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence (TONI-4). Furthermore, the Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM), Manual Muscle Tests and a therapist-derived score of how well the child was able to train were assessed. Results showed that muscle activity and heart rate were higher during the demanding part of the game (30.7 +/- 22.6 muV; 129.4 +/- 15.7 bpm) compared to the less demanding part (16.0 +/- 13.4 muV; 124.1 +/- 15.9 bpm; p<0.01 for both measures). Game performance correlated moderately with the TONI-4 (r=0.50, p=0.04) and the cognition subscale of the WeeFIM (rho=0.59, p=0.01). The therapist-derived score correlated significantly with game performance (p=0.75, p<0.01) and the ability to modify muscle activity to the demands of the game (p=-0.72, p<0.01). Receiver operating  characteristic analyses revealed that the latter factor differentiated well between those children suitable for the game and those not.

METHODS: Participants included parents  of boys (aged 8-18) with ASD (n = 56), ADHD (n = 44), or TD (n = 41). Questionnaires assessed daily hours of video game use, in-room video game access, video game genres, problematic video game use, ASD symptoms, and ADHD symptoms. RESULTS: Boys with ASD spent more time than did boys with TD playing video games  (2.1 vs 1.2 h/d). Both the ASD and ADHD groups had greater in-room video game access and greater problematic video game use than the TD group. Multivariate models showed that inattentive symptoms predicted problematic game use for both the ASD and ADHD groups; and preferences for role-playing games predicted problematic game use in the ASD group only. CONCLUSIONS: Boys with ASD spend much more time playing video games than do boys with TD, and boys with ASD and ADHD are at greater risk for problematic video game use than are boys with TD. Inattentive symptoms, in particular, were strongly associated with problematic video game use for both groups, and role-playing game preferences may be an additional risk factor for problematic video game use among children with ASD. These findings suggest a need for longitudinal research to better understand predictors and outcomes of video game use in children with ASD and ADHD.",treatment,1.0,1

The neurocognitive causes of dyslexia are still hotly debated [3-12]. Dyslexia remediation is far from being fully achieved [13], and the current treatments demand high levels of resources [1]. Here, we demonstrate that only 12 hr of playing action video games-not involving any direct phonological or orthographic  training-drastically improve the reading abilities of children with dyslexia. We  tested reading, phonological, and attentional skills in two matched groups of children with dyslexia before and after they played action or nonaction video games for nine sessions of 80 min per day. We found that only playing action video games improved children's reading speed, without any cost in accuracy, more so than 1 year of spontaneous reading development and more than or equal to highly demanding traditional reading treatments. Attentional skills also improved during action video game training. It has been demonstrated that action video games efficiently improve attention abilities [14, 15]; our results showed that this attention improvement can directly translate into better reading abilities,  providing a new, fast, fun remediation of dyslexia that has theoretical relevance in unveiling the causal role of attention in reading acquisition.",treatment,0.35229660870566554,1

Because this intervention will probably be time consuming, this system should be  designed to be used at homes. To make this possible, we propose an implementation based on wireless and dry electrooculography (EOG) technology.

Here, we investigated a new more intensive BCI-based attention training game system on 20  unmedicated ADHD children (16 males, 4 females) with significant inattentive symptoms (combined and inattentive ADHD subtypes). This new system monitored attention through a head band with dry EEG sensors, which was used to drive a feed forward game. The system was calibrated for each user by measuring the EEG parameters during a Stroop task. Treatment consisted of an 8-week training comprising 24 sessions followed by 3 once-monthly booster training sessions. Following intervention, both parent-rated inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms on the ADHD Rating Scale showed significant improvement.

The study design was a double-blind within-subject crossover design. Aggression was assessed using a Point subtraction aggression game (PSAG) with high (HP) and low provocation (LP) trials 2.5 h after the intake of ATD and a tryptophan-balanced control condition. RESULTS: A chi-square comparison was used to identify the effect of ATD on increased aggression after LP. Boys were more likely to respond with an increased aggressive response after HP under ATD as represented by an increased relative risk and odds ratios. Girls had a higher relative risk than boys of an increased  point subtraction under ATD after LP. No significant gender differences in decision-time were detected.

There is also emerging evidence of an association between computer game and videogame addiction and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This is  indicated by the occurrence of gaming addiction as a co-morbid disorder of ADHD,  common physiological and pharmacological mechanisms, and potential genetic association between the two disorders. A proper understanding of the psychological and neurotransmitter mechanisms underlying both disorders is important for appropriate diagnostic classification of both disorders.

RESULTS: Analyses revealed positive correlations between tobacco, alcohol and cannabis use and a smaller positive correlation between problematic gambling and problematic computer gaming. Problematic computer gaming co-occurred only with cannabis use,  whereas problematic gambling was associated with all three types of substance use. Multivariate multilevel analyses showed differential patterns of personality characteristics. High impulsivity was the only personality characteristic associated with all five addictive behaviours.

Both groups completed  three weekly sessions of WM training. Children using the game version of the WM training showed greater motivation (i.e., more time training), better training performance (i.e., more sequences reproduced and fewer errors), and better WM (i.e., higher scores on a WM task) at post-training than children using the regular WM training. Results are discussed in terms of executive functions and reinforcement models of ADHD. It is concluded that WM training with game elements significantly improves the motivation, training performance, and working memory of children with ADHD.

The aim of the present study was to assess the levels of stress and stress mitigation in healthy school children (HSC), in children with cystic fibrosis (CF), general anxiety (GA) and attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: Each investigated group (HSC, CF, GA, ADHD) consisted of 30 school-aged children from both sexes. Psychological characteristics were evaluated on Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ). The lie scale was used to determine participant honesty. Four biofeedback  games using a pulls detector were applied for assessment of the stress levels as  well as to evaluate ability to relax. RESULTS: EPQ found more psychopathological  traits (P < 0.001) and less extroversion (P < 0.001) in children with GA and ADHD. In addition, high neurotic tendencies were found in children with CF (P < 0.01) and GA (P < 0.01). Unexpectedly, the lie scale was lower in ADHD children (P < 0.01) than in all other groups (HSC, CF, GA). The Magic blocks score was significantly different in relaxation levels between control and CF children (P < 0.05). Speed in the game Canal was significantly different in relaxation levels between healthy controls and all other groups, but no changes in pulls, as a relaxation measure, were found during the game. The CF group had much more commissions stemming from impulsivity (t= 5.71, P < 0.01), while the GA and ADHD  children had more inattention omissions (P < 0.05).

We hypothesized that MPH treatment would reduce Internet use in subjects with co-occurring ADHD and Internet video game addictions. METHODS: Sixty-two children (52 males and 10 females), drug-naive, diagnosed with ADHD, and Internet video game players, participated in this study. At the beginning of the study and after 8 weeks of treatment with Concerta (OROS methylphenidate HCl, Seoul, Korea), participants were assessed with Young's Internet Addiction Scale, Korean version  (YIAS-K), Korean DuPaul's ADHD Rating Scale, and the Visual Continuous Performance Test.

The intervention was directed at the classroom as a whole to socialize children to the student role and reduce aggressive, disruptive behaviors, confirmed antecedents of later substance abuse and dependence disorders, smoking, and antisocial personality disorder. This article reports on impact to ages 19-21. METHODS: In five poor to lower-middle class, mainly African American urban areas, three or four schools were matched and within each set randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) GBG, (2) a curriculum-and-instruction program directed at reading achievement, or (3) the standard program. Balanced assignment of children to classrooms was made, and then, within intervention schools, classrooms and teachers were randomly assigned to intervention or control. RESULTS: By young adulthood significant impact was found among males, particularly those in first grade who were more aggressive, disruptive, in reduced drug and alcohol abuse/dependence disorders, regular smoking, and antisocial personality disorder. These results underline the value of a first-grade universal prevention intervention.

The GBG was tested in a randomized field trial in 19 elementary schools with two cohorts of children as they attended first and second grades. This article reports on the impact of the GBG on service use through young adulthood. METHODS: Three or four schools in each of five urban areas were matched and randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) GBG, (2) an intervention aimed at academic achievement, or (3) the standard program of the school system. Children  were assigned to classrooms to ensure balance, and teachers and classrooms were randomly assigned to intervention conditions. RESULTS: This study provides evidence of a positive impact of a universal preventive intervention on later service use by males, although not by females, for problems with emotions, behavior, or drugs or alcohol. For both cohorts, males in GBG classrooms who had  been rated as highly aggressive, disruptive by their teachers in the fall of first grade had a lower rate of school-based service use than their counterparts  in control classrooms. REPLICATION: The design employed two cohorts of students.  Although both first- and second-grade teachers received less training and support with the second cohorts of students than with the first cohort, the impact of GBG was similar across both cohorts.",treatment,0.22642215568862276,1

In the 1985-1986 school year teachers implemented the Good Behavior Game (GBG), a classroom behavior management strategy targeting aggressive, disruptive behavior and socializing children to the student role. From first through seventh grade the developmental trajectories of 2311 students from 19 Baltimore City Public Schools were examined. We report the GBG impact on these trajectories and ASPD and violent and criminal behavior by age 19-21. METHODS: In five urban, poor to lower middle class predominately African-American areas, three to four schools were matched and within each set randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) GBG, (2) a reading achievement  program, or (3) the standard program. Classrooms and teachers were randomly assigned to intervention or control. Measures at 19-21 included self reports and  juvenile court and adult incarceration records. GBG impact was assessed via General Growth Mixture Modeling based on repeated measures of aggressive, disruptive behavior. RESULTS: Three trajectories of aggressive, disruptive behavior were identified. By young adulthood, GBG significantly reduced the rates of ASPD and violent and criminal behavior among males in the persistent high aggressive, disruptive trajectory. REPLICATION: A replication was implemented with the following cohort of first-grade children using the same teachers, but with diminished mentoring and monitoring. Beneficial impact was found among persistent high males through seventh grade. By young adulthood GBG effects on ASPD and violent and criminal behavior were non-significant, but generally in the hypothesized direction.",treatment,0.0748610951174574,0

METHODS: Twenty-two male adolescent patients with ADHD received the RTD test on one day, and, on another day a tryptophan balanced placebo in a double-blind within-subject crossover design. Impulsive personality factors and trait-impulsivity were assessed in advance of the study. Aggression was provoked using a competitive reaction time game 270 min after RTD/placebo intake. RESULTS: RTD had a significant effect on increased aggressive behaviour with which low-grade impulsive patients responded. High-grade impulsive patients were not affected by RTD or even responded with increased aggressive behaviour while receiving placebo treatment.

Motivational factors, related to dopamine dysfunction, may play an important role in the development of the behavioral symptoms. Particularly, infrequent, but not frequent, reinforcers  have been suggested to be associated with altered responding and deviant behavior in children with ADHD. The present study was designed to analyze the influence of reinforcement frequency on operationalized measures of hyperactivity, impulsiveness, sustained attention, and response variability. METHODS: Fifty-six  boys, half of whom were diagnosed with ADHD, completed a computerized task presented as a game with two squares on the screen. One square was associated with reinforcement. The task required responses by the computer mouse under contingencies alternating between variable interval schedules of short (mean 2 s) and long (mean 20 s) durations. Reinforcers were cartoon pictures and small trinkets. RESULTS: Overall, there was no difference between children with ADHD and comparison children when reinforcers were given frequently. Statistically significant differences on measures of sustained attention and variability, but not hyperactivity and impulsiveness, were found during infrequent reinforcement only. Age effects interacted with group effects on sustained attention, showing that group differences were found in the young children only. Surprisingly, older comparison children showed increased response variability and no learning. CONCLUSIONS: When reinforcers are infrequent, children with ADHD show deficient sustained attention and increased variability in responding. Computer experience  may have interfered with measures of hyperactivity and impulsiveness. The unexpectedly poor performance of the older comparison children may have been due  to inefficient reinforcers or to verbally governed behavior overruling reinforcer effects. Reinforcer characteristics and experimental procedures are important factors influencing findings in studies investigating motivational factors. The study provides some support for the dynamic developmental theory of ADHD predicting relationships between neurobiological deficits, altered reinforcement  mechanisms, and treatment recommendations.",treatment,0.2733763242745278,1

AIMS: Children's responses to a computerized grammatical training program were evaluated to consider whether repeated responding to spoken sentences with variable semantic content and the same syntactic structure would lead to consistent and fluent comprehension. METHODS & PROCEDURES: Children with receptive language impairments aged from 8 to 13 years were randomly assigned to  three groups: Group S (n = 12) responded to reversible sentences in a computerized game, using speech stimuli with pauses before critical phrases. Group M (n = 12) had the same stimuli acoustically modified to lengthen and amplify dynamic portions of the signal. Group U (n = 9) was an untrained control  group. On average, children in groups S and M completed over 1000 training trials, focusing on training comprehension of reversible sentences. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: Although responses speeded up over the course of training, and most children performed well above chance, accuracy typically remained below 95% correct for constructions such as above/below and reversible active/passive. Trained groups did not differ from untrained children on language or auditory outcomes. There was no evidence that acoustically modified speech input enhanced  comprehension. CONCLUSIONS: Rote training of comprehension of reversible sentences does not seem to be an effective approach to remediating such problems. For most children, the pattern of performance suggested that the problem was not  a lack of syntactic knowledge, bur rather limited processing capacity that led to failures of on-line computation of meaning.",treatment,0.20891510248733303,1

Detailed evidence is given from a micro-analytic study of videos of monozygotic twin girls at 11 months, one of whom became autistic in the second year. Changes in this twin's attention, motor tonus, initiative and emotion reduce her prospective control of movements and her anticipations in awareness compared to her sister. These changes were reflected in the child's asynchronous  social behaviour, which frustrated the father's attempts to support her attempts  to walk, share toys, or play a game, confusing his anticipations, and this further reduced mutual attention and joint activity. Observations of the development of girls with Rett syndrome in the first year reveal changes in motor coordination, attention and communicative initiative, indicative of a failure of  intrinsic core brain regulations of neural development and conscious activity. Notwithstanding that the two conditions show clear differences in both brain growth and early development of skills and sociability, the first signs of autism and Rett syndrome have important similarities. We conclude with recommendations for an approach to early diagnosis and treatment, applicable for the whole range  of developmental brain disorders, including Rett syndrome and autism, that attempts to identify residual capacities for sympathetic motivation and collaborative learning-an approach that deliberately tries to support weakened rhythmic impulses for motor, perceptual and communicative functions in the growing infant brain.",treatment,0.024840943113772454,0

The need for multiple doses produces problems  with medication administration during school and after-school hours, and therefore with compliance. Previous long-acting stimulants and preparations have  shown effects equivalent to twice-daily dosing of MPH. This study tests the efficacy and duration of action, in natural and laboratory settings, of an extended-release MPH preparation designed to last 12 hours and therefore be equivalent to 3-times-daily dosing. METHODS: Sixty-eight children with ADHD, 6 to 12 years old, participated in a within-subject, double-blind comparison of placebo, immediate-release (IR) MPH 3 times a day (tid), and Concerta, a once-daily MPH formulation. Three dosing levels of medication were used: 5 mg IR  MPH tid/18 mg Concerta once a day (qd); 10 mg IR MPH tid/36 mg Concerta qd; and 15 mg IR MPH tid/54 mg Concerta qd. All children were currently medicated with MPH at enrollment, and each child's dose level was based on that child's MPH dosing before the study. The doses of Concerta were selected to be comparable to  the daily doses of MPH that each child received. To achieve the ascending rate of MPH delivery determined by initial investigations to provide the necessary continuous coverage, Concerta doses were 20% higher on a daily basis than a comparable tid regimen of IR MPH. Children received each medication condition for 7 days. The investigation was conducted in the context of a background clinical behavioral intervention in both the natural environment and the laboratory setting. Parents received behavioral parent training and teachers were taught to  establish a school-home daily report card (DRC). A DRC is a list of individual target behaviors that represent a child's most salient areas of impairment. Teachers set daily goals for each child's impairment targets, and parents provided rewards at home for goal attainment. Each weekday, teachers completed the DRC, and it was used as a dependent measure of individualized medication response. Teachers and parents also completed weekly standardized ratings of behavior and treatment effectiveness. To evaluate the time course of medication effects, children spent 12 hours in a laboratory setting on Saturdays and medication effects were measured using procedures and methods adapted from our summer treatment program. Measures of classroom behavior and academic productivity/accuracy were taken in a laboratory classroom setting during which children completed independent math and reading worksheets. Measures of social behavior were taken in structured, small-group board game settings and unstructured recess settings. Measures included behavior frequency counts, academic problems completed and accuracy, independent observations, teacher and counselor ratings, and individualized behavioral target goals. Reports of adverse events, sleep quality, and appetite were collected. RESULTS: On virtually all measures in all settings, both drug conditions were significantly different from  placebo, and the 2 drugs were not different from each other. In children's regular school settings, both medications improved behavior as measured by teacher ratings and individualized target behaviors (the DRC); these effects were seen into the evening as measured by parent ratings. In the laboratory setting, effects of Concerta were equivalent to tid MPH and lasted at least through 12 hours after dosing. Concerta was significantly superior to tid MPH on 2 parent rating scores, and when asked, more parents preferred Concerta than preferred tid IR MPH or placebo. Side effects on children's sleep and appetite were similar for the 2 preparations. In the lab setting, both medications improved productivity and accuracy on arithmetic seatwork assignments, disruptive and on-task behavior, and classroom rule following. Both medications improved children's rule following and negative behavior in small group board games, as well as in unstructured recess settings. Individual target behaviors also showed significant improvement  with medication across domains in the laboratory setting. Children's behavior across settings deteriorated across the laboratory day, and the primary effect of medication was to prevent this deterioration as the day wore on. Results support  the use of background behavioral treatment in clinical trials of stimulant medication, and illustrate the utility of a measure of individualized daily target goals (ie, the DRC) as an objective measure of medication response in both the laboratory and natural school settings. CONCLUSION: This investigation clearly supports the efficacy of the Concerta long-acting formulation of MPH for  parents who desire to have medication benefits for their child throughout the day and early evening.

The experiment consisted of rewarding children for responding in a computer 'game' on two keys of a keyboard during each of three phases. In phase 1, rewards were provided independently of sequence variability (IND). In phase 2, rewards depended upon highly variable sequences of left and right responses. Phase 3 was  a return to the IND contingencies. The results showed that sequence variability was higher in the sequence variability (VARY) phase than in the preceding IND phase, but remained high when the contingencies returned to IND, thus replicating previous findings. In none of the phases did the ADHD children respond more variably than the controls. However, ADHD subjects made more off-task responses than did controls.

However, video gaming has been associated with the enhancement of cognitive function. Moreover, despite comparable extensive video gaming, pro gamers have not shown any of the negative symptoms that individuals with GD have reported. It is important to understand the association between extensive video gaming and alterations in brain regions more objectively. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically explore the association between extensive video gaming and changes in cognitive function by focusing on pro gamers and individuals with GD. METHODS: Studies about pro gamers and individuals with GD were searched for in the PubMed and Web of Science databases using relevant search terms, for example, ""pro-gamers"" and ""(Internet) gaming disorder."" While studies for pro gamers were searched for without date restrictions, only studies published since 2013 about individuals with GD were included in search results. Article selection was conducted by following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. RESULTS: By following the PRISMA guidelines, 1903 records with unique titles were identified. Through the screening process of titles and abstracts, 86 full-text articles were accessed to determine their eligibility. A total of 18 studies were included in this systematic review. Among the included 18 studies, six studies included pro gamers as participants, one study included both pro gamers and individuals with GD, and 11 studies included individuals with GD. Pro  gamers showed structural and functional alterations in brain regions (eg, the left cingulate cortex, the insula subregions, and the prefrontal regions). Cognitive function (eg, attention and sensorimotor function) and cognitive control improved in pro gamers. Individuals with GD showed structural and functional alterations in brain regions (eg, the striatum, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the amygdala) that were associated with impaired cognitive control and higher levels of craving video game playing. They also showed increased cortical thickness in the middle temporal cortex, which indicated the acquisition of better skills. Moreover, it was suggested that various factors (eg, gaming expertise, duration or severity of GD, and level of self-control) seemed to modulate the association of extensive video game playing with changes in cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: Although a limited number of studies were identified that included pro gamers and/or individuals who reported showing symptoms of GD for more than 1 year, this review contributed to the objective understanding of the association between extensive video game playing and changes in cognitive function. Conducting studies with a longitudinal design or with various comparison groups in the future would be helpful in deepening the understanding of this association.",cognitive enhancement,1.0,1

In particular, the specifications of a neurofeedback-based video game for children dealing with ADHD, in order to enhance attention and concentration skills, are analyzed. Potential boundaries of this cognitive enhancement approach and authors future directions are also discussed.",cognitive enhancement,0.0,0

Children  with ADHD often demonstrate impaired executive function, which is closely related to the development of the commonly observed behavioral problems such as inattention, impaired inhibition, and hyperactivity. The purpose of this study is to examine whether a game-based high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program can improve the executive function of children with ADHD, compared with a traditional structured aerobic exercise program and a non-treatment control group. METHODS/DESIGN: A total of 42 children with ADHD will be recruited to participate in this three-arm school-based randomized controlled trial. An 8-week specially designed game-based HIIT (GameHIIT) program and a traditional game-based structured aerobic exercise (GameSAE) program will be delivered to those children randomly assigned to these two intervention groups, while the children in the control group will maintain their regular physical activity over  the same period. A number of outcome measures including executive function, cerebral hemodynamic response, physical activity, physical fitness, and enjoyment and adherence to the intervention will be assessed for both groups at baseline (T0), immediately after the intervention period (T1), and after the follow-up period (T2). DISCUSSION: HIIT has recently emerged as a feasible and efficacious  strategy for increasing physical health outcomes and cognitive function, including executive function, in healthy young people. However, research has yet  to investigate whether the executive function of children with ADHD can be effectively enhanced through HIIT. If, as hypothesized, GameHIIT program improves outcomes for children with ADHD, the present research will inform the development of targeted exercise programs that can be more broadly used with this particular  population.",diagnosis support,0.48039250416238627,1

We continuously record the participants' activity throughout  the task and calculate the error committed. Studying the trajectory graphs, some  children showed uniform patterns, others lost attention from one point onwards, and others alternated attention/inattention intervals. Results show a dependence  between the age of the children and their performance.

Children with ADHD are developmentally vulnerable, with the disorder linked to emotional regulation difficulties, behavioural disturbances, as well as academic challenges. Emerging evidence suggests that children with ADHD may benefit from cognitive training interventions, including those focused on attention. This study aims to assess the immediate and long-term efficacy of an attention training intervention in children with ADHD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is  a preregistered, parallel, double blind, randomised controlled trial. Participants will comprise 104 children with a diagnosis of ADHD aged 5-8 years 11 months. Participants will be randomly allocated to either an adaptive, digital game-based (1) attention training programme (intervention) or (2) a numeracy programme (control). Both programmes will be delivered on a touchscreen tablet, and children will complete five 20 min sessions per week for a 5-week period at home (25 sessions in total). Assessments of the primary outcome (ie, attention and inhibitory control) and secondary outcomes (ie, selective attention, interference control, sustained attention, inhibition, behavioural attention, impairment in everyday functioning, working memory and executive functioning) will occur at preintervention, immediately postintervention and at 3-month follow-up. Multivariate linear regression will be employed to examine primary and secondary outcomes. The data analyst will be blinded to group membership.

Despite prior studies having identified gender-related differences in the neural correlates of IGD, gender-related differences in the involvement of brain networks remain unclear. METHODS: One-hundred-and-nine individuals with IGD (54 males) and 111 with recreational game use (RGU; 58 males) provided resting-state fMRI data. We examined gender-related differences in involvement of addiction brain networks in IGD versus RGU subjects. We further compared the strength between and within addiction brain networks and explored possible relationships between the strength of functional connectivities within and between addiction brain networks and several relevant behavioral measures. RESULTS: The addiction brain networks showed high correct classification rates in distinguishing IGD and RGU subjects in men and women. Male subjects with versus without IGD showed stronger functional connectivities between and within addiction brain networks. Moreover, the strength of the connectivity within the anticipation network in male IGD subjects was positively related to subjective craving. However, female subjects with versus without IGD showed decreased functional connections between and within addiction brain networks. The strength  of connectivity between the anticipation and negative-affect brain networks in female IGD subjects was negatively related to maladaptive cognitive emotion-regulation strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Addiction brain networks have potential for distinguishing IGD and RGU individuals. Importantly, this study identified novel gender-related differences in brain-behavior relationships in IGD. These results help advance current neuroscientific theories of IGD and may inform gender-informed treatment strategies.",diagnosis support,0.3755180842396118,1

Hence, it is important to consider other pathways to improve the efficiency of early diagnosis, including the role of artificial intelligence. In this study, we reviewed the current literature on machine learning and deep learning studies on ADHD diagnosis and identified the various diagnostic tools used. Subsequently, we categorized these studies according to their diagnostic tool as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), physiological signals, questionnaires, game simulator and performance test, and motion data. We identified research gaps include the paucity of publicly available database for all modalities in ADHD assessment other than MRI, as well as a lack of focus on using data from wearable devices for ADHD diagnosis, such as ECG, PPG, and motion data. We hope that this review will inspire future work to create more publicly available datasets and conduct research for other modes of ADHD diagnosis and monitoring.

Critically, these difficulties are related to negative consequences in real-life functioning both during development and into adulthood. There is now growing evidence that modulating the underlying neural circuits related to attention can improve behavior and brain function in children with ADHD. We have previously shown that  game-based digital therapeutics targeting a key neural marker of attention-midline frontal theta (MFT)-yield positive effects on attentional control in several populations. However, the effects of such digital therapeutics in children with ADHD and no other comorbidities has not been yet examined. To address this gap, we assessed a sample of 25 children with ADHD (8-12 years old)  on neural, behavioral, and clinical metrics of attention before and after a 4-week at-home intervention on an iPad targeting MFT circuitry. We found that children showed enhancements on a neural measure of attention (MFT power), as well as on objective behavioral measures of attention and parent reports of clinical ADHD symptoms. Importantly, we observed relationships between the neural and behavioral cognitive improvements, demonstrating that those children who showed the largest intervention-related neural gains were also those that improved the most on the behavioral tasks indexing attention. These findings provide support for using targeted, digital therapeutics to enhance multiple features of attentional control in children with ADHD.

Understanding the association may help develop policies and interventions targeting specific screen activities to promote healthful screen use and mental health in children and youth. Objective: To determine whether specific forms of screen use (television [TV] or digital media, video games, electronic learning, and video-chatting time) were associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety, conduct problems, irritability, hyperactivity, and inattention in children and youth during COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: A longitudinal cohort study with repeated measures of exposures and outcomes was conducted in children  and youth aged 2 to 18 years in Ontario, Canada, between May 2020 and April 2021  across 4 cohorts of children or youth: 2 community cohorts and 2 clinically referred cohorts. Parents were asked to complete repeated questionnaires about their children's health behaviors and mental health symptoms during COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: The exposure variables were children's daily TV or digital media time, video game time, electronic-learning time, and video-chatting time. The mental health outcomes were parent-reported symptoms of child depression, anxiety, conduct problems and irritability, and hyperactivity/inattention using validated standardized tools. Results: This study included 2026 children with 6648 observations. In younger children (mean [SD] age, 5.9 [2.5] years; 275 male participants [51.7%]), higher TV or digital media  time was associated with higher levels of conduct problems (age 2-4 years: beta,  0.22 [95% CI, 0.10-0.35]; P < .001; age >/=4 years: beta, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.02-0.11]; P = .007) and hyperactivity/inattention (beta, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.006-0.14]; P = .04). In older children and youth (mean [SD] age, 11.3 [3.3] years; 844 male participants [56.5%]), higher levels of TV or digital media time  were associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and inattention; higher levels of video game time were associated with higher levels of depression, irritability, inattention, and hyperactivity. Higher levels of electronic learning time were associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, higher levels of screen use were associated poor mental health of children and youth during the COVID-19  pandemic. These findings suggest that policy intervention as well as evidence-informed social supports are needed to promote healthful screen use and  mental health in children and youth during the pandemic and beyond.",diagnosis support,0.467639661341174,1

Behavioural intervention in preschool children with ADHD is  considered effective. This study discussed the long-term effectiveness of behavioural intervention in the context of nondrug therapy. METHODS: The study was a prospective, randomised controlled trial in which 201 preschoolers diagnosed with ADHD who were not receiving any treatment were assigned to two groups from January 2018 to May 2019, 101 were assigned to the conventional group and 100 to the behavioural intervention group. The behavioural intervention group included parental training, behavioural therapy, attention training, relief therapy and game therapy, in addition to the conventional group offerings. Children were evaluated at a baseline, at the end of the 12-month intervention and six months after the intervention. The primary and secondary outcome variables included attention time, the impulse-hyperactivity and hyperactivity index from Conners parent symptom questionnaire (PSQ), full-scale attention quotient (FAQ) and full-scale response control quotient (FRCQ) from integrated visual and auditory comprehensive continuous performance tests. The attention time was observed and recorded by parents, and others were performe(PSQ)d by physicians in the clinic. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS V26.0 (IBM), including the descriptive statistics and mixed-effects models and so on. RESULTS: The participants' mean age was (66.17+/-9.00) months in the behavioural group and (67.54+/-6.22) months in the conventional group .A total of 190 participants completed a follow-up six months after the intervention. The attention time, Conners parent symptom questionnaire (PSQ), full-scale attention  quotient (FAQ) and full-scale response control quotient (FRCQ) increased significantly over time, and the behavioural group improvements were higher than  those of conventional group.

However, little is known about brain network organizations underlying cravings in internet gaming disorder (IGD). METHODS: Sixty-six IGD subjects and 61 matched individuals with recreational game use (RGU) were scanned while performing a cue-craving task. A recently developed  whole-brain analysis approach, connectome-based predictive modelling (CPM) with leave-one-out cross-validation was conducted to identify networks that predicted  craving responses in IGD. Then, the craving network was tested in different brain states (cue-craving under deprivation) to investigate replicability. RESULTS: CPM identified an IGD craving network, as indicated by a significant correspondence between predicted and actual craving values (r = 0.49, p < 0.001), characterized  by within-network default mode (DMN) connectivity and connectivity between canonical networks implicated in executive/cognitive control (frontoparietal, medial frontal, DMN) and reward responsiveness (subcortical, motor/sensory). Network strength in the cue-craving task during gaming deprivation also predicted IGD craving scores (r = 0.43, p = 0.017), indicating network replication across brain states.

To examine the potential of a nonverbal battery in early identification of cognitive problems in alcohol-exposed children, 291 prospectively identified Ukrainian children were evaluated using a test battery focusing on early executive functioning (EF) and visuospatial skills, areas of cognitive development particularly sensitive to PAE in older children. Tests included the Differential  Ability Scales, 2(nd) Edition (DAS-2) and several NEPSY/NEPSY-II subtests, standardized in the United States. Others were adapted from commonly used non-standardized neuropsychological measures of EF (Preschool Spatial Span, Imitation Hand Game, A not B, Delayed Attention, Subject Ordered Pointing). Children in two sites in Ukraine, Rivne and Khmelnitsky, were tested at 3 (1/2)-4 (1/2) years to identify effects of PAE. Although most children performed within the average range, Alcohol-Exposed preschoolers had lower scores on DAS-II Summary Scores as well as on specific subtests. To evaluate the effects of alcohol dose during the pre-pregnancy recognition period and during mid-gestation of pregnancy, generalized linear regression models were used controlling for demographic and individual variables. In addition to DAS-II variables, measures reflecting sustained attention, working memory and ability to shift cognitive set were impacted by alcohol dose. Early executive function appears to subsume these  performance differences.

Decreased FC was predominantly observed in IGD subjects, with IGD subjects showing decreased FC between the putamen and superior frontal gyrus (SFG), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the ventral striatum and IFG, superior temporal gyrus, and MFG. Disorder severity and craving scores were negatively correlated with FC between striatal and frontal brain regions. Associations between diminished FC in corticostriatal circuitry and clinical features (IGD craving, severity) suggest potential therapeutic targets for neuromodulation treatments. The extent to which frontostriatal circuits involving executive control over reward processes may be altered to treat IGD warrants additional study.",diagnosis support,0.3755180842396118,1

This article proposes the ""running raccoon"" video game to assess the severity of inattention in patients diagnosed with ADHD. Unlike existing tests, the proposed tool is a genuine video game in which the patient must make a raccoon avatar jump to avoid falling into different gaps. The distance to the gap is recorded for each jump. To evaluate the proposed game, an experiment was conducted in which 32 children diagnosed with ADHD participated. For each participant, the median and interquartile range of these distances were calculated, along with the number of omissions. Experimental results showed a significant correlation between the participants' inattention (measured by the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms and Normal Behavior rating scale (SWAN) inattention subscale) with each of these three measures. In addition to its accuracy, other benefits are its short duration and the possibility of being run on both standard computers and mobile devices. These characteristics facilitate its acceptance in clinical environments or even its telematic use. The obtained results, together with the characteristics of the video game, make it an excellent tool to support clinicians in the diagnosis of ADHD.",diagnosis support,0.4619894434801092,1

However, the neurobiological basis underlying these relationships remains unclear. METHODS: In the current study, Granger causal analysis was performed to investigate amygdalar subdivision-based resting-state effective connectivity differences between 111 IGD subjects and 120 matched participants with recreational game use (RGUs). We further correlated neuroimaging findings with clinical measures. Mediation analysis was conducted to explore whether amygdalar subdivision-based effective connectivity mediated the relationship between IGD severity and loneliness. RESULTS: Compared with RGUs, IGD subjects showed inhibitory effective connections from the left pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) to the left laterobasal  amygdala (LBA) and from the right medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to the left LBA, as well as an excitatory effective connection from the left middle prefrontal gyrus (MFG) to the right superficial amygdala. Further analyses demonstrated that the left pACC-left LBA effective connection was negatively correlated with both Internet Addiction Test and UCLA Loneliness scores, and it mediated the relationship between the two.

However, it remains unclear how these two systems interact with each other, and whether they could serve as neurobiological markers for IGD. METHODS: Fifty IGD subjects and matched individuals with recreational game use (RGU) were selected and compared when they were performing a cue-craving task. Regions of interests [anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), lentiform nucleus] were selected based on the comparison between brain responses to gaming-related cues and neutral cues. Directional connectivities among these brain regions were determined using Bayesian estimation. We additionally examined the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in a separate analysis based on data implicating the PCC in craving in addiction. RESULTS: During fixed-connectivity analyses, IGD subjects showed blunted ACC-to-lentiform and lentiform-to-ACC connectivity relative to RGU subjects, especially in the left hemisphere. When facing gaming cues, IGD subjects trended toward lower left-hemispheric modulatory effects in ACC-to-lentiform connectivity than RGU subjects. Self-reported cue-related craving prior to scanning correlated inversely with left-hemispheric modulatory effects in ACC-to-lentiform connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggesting that prefrontal-to-lentiform connectivity is impaired in IGD provides a possible  neurobiological mechanism for difficulties in controlling gaming-cue-elicited cravings.

Children with an acquired brain injury (ABI) are particularly susceptible to attention deficits and may benefit from interventions aimed at enhancing attention. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the short-term efficacy of the TALI Train programme, compared with a placebo, on the outcome of attention in children with ABI. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is a parallel, double-blind, randomised controlled trial. Participants will consist of 80 children with a diagnosis of ABI aged 4-9 years 11 months. Participants will be randomly allocated to either (1) TALI Train (intervention group), an adaptive game-based attention training programme, or (2) a non-adaptive placebo programme (control group). Both programmes are delivered on a touchscreen tablet, and children complete five 20 min sessions per week for a 5-week period at home. Assessment of selective, sustained and executive attention (primary outcomes), and behavioural  attention, working memory, social skills and mathematics ability (secondary outcomes) will occur at baseline, post-training, and at 3-month and 6-month follow-up to assess immediate and long-term efficacy of TALI Train compared with  placebo. Assessments will be completed at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia. All assessments and analyses will be undertaken by researchers blinded to group membership. Latent growth curve modelling will be employed to examine primary and secondary outcomes.

The goal  of this study was to investigate reward delay impulsivity in children with LOC-E, ADHD, or a double diagnosis, in contrast to healthy children. Children (8 to 13 years) with LOC-E (n = 24), ADHD (n = 33), a double diagnosis (n = 9), and healthy children (n = 34) performed a computer game (door opening task [DOT]) and the delay of gratification task (DoGT) to assess food related facets of reward delay impulsivity. In addition, children reported whether they worried to lose control over eating during the DoGT. There were no group differences in the DOT.  However, children with ADHD or a double diagnosis had a significantly higher risk to eat prematurely during the DoGT than children with LOC-E, who were not significantly different from healthy children. Children with a double diagnosis were most likely to worry about losing control over eating during the DoGT, followed by children with LOC-E, and both had a significantly higher probability  to worry than healthy children. For children with a double diagnosis the probability to worry was significantly higher than for children with ADHD. If replicated, these findings point to a special relevance of reward delay impulsivity in children with ADHD or a double diagnosis, compared to children with LOC-E.

RGU_IGD and RGU_RGU subjects showed similarities in the cue-elicited-craving task before gaming. Significant group-by-time interaction identified the bilateral lentiform  nucleus. Post hoc analysis showed the interaction was related to increased activation in the RGU_IGD subjects following gaming. Significant correlations were observed between self-reported cravings and lentiform activation in the RGU_IGD subjects.

However, little is known about brain network organizational changes underlying behavior improvement following BCI-based training. To cover this gap, we aimed to examine the topological alterations of large-scale brain functional networks induced by the 8-week BCI-based attention intervention in ADHD boys using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging method. Compared to the non-intervention (ADHD-NI) group, the intervention group (ADHD-I) showed greater reduction of inattention symptoms accompanied with differential brain network reorganizations after training. Specifically, the ADHD-NI group had increased functional connectivity (FC) within the salience/ventral attention network (SVN) and increased FC between task-positive networks (including the SVN, dorsal attention (DAN), somatomotor, and executive control network) and subcortical regions; in contrast ADHD-I group  did not have this pattern. In parallel, ADHD-I group had reduced degree centrality and clustering coefficient as well as increased closeness in task-positive and the default mode networks (prefrontal regions) after the training. More importantly, these reduced local functional processing mainly in the SVN were associated with less inattentive/internalizing problems after 8-week BCI-based intervention across ADHD patients. Our findings suggest that the BCI-based attention training facilitates behavioral improvement in ADHD children  by reorganizing brain functional network from more regular to more random configurations, particularly renormalizing salience network processing.

Twelve internet-addicted adolescents and fifteen adolescents without addiction reported whether short phrases described themselves, a well-known historical person, or their own game character while undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Different patterns of  activity emerged for adolescents with internet game addiction compared to healthy adolescents when they were thinking about themselves, another person, and their game characters. Specifically, when addicted adolescents were thinking about their own game characters, more global and significant medial prefrontal (MPFC) and anterior cingulate (ACC) activations were observed, than even when compared to thinking about themselves. The ACC activation was correlated with the symptom  severity.

METHOD: Pre-intervention characteristics [i.e., gender, age, intellectual level of functioning, medication use, computer experience, ADHD subtype, severity of inattention problems, severity of hyperactivity/impulsivity problems, comorbid Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)  and Conduct Disorder (CD) symptoms] were explored as potential moderators in a Virtual Twins (VT) analysis to identify subgroups for whom the SG intervention was most effective. Primary outcome measures were parent-reported time management, planning/organizing and cooperation skills. RESULTS: Two subgroups were identified. Girls (n = 26) were identified as the subgroup that was most likely to show greater improvements in planning/organizing skills as compared to  the estimated treatment effect of the total group of participants. Furthermore, among the boys, those (n = 47) with lower baseline levels of hyperactivity and higher levels of CD symptoms showed more improvements in their planning/organizing skills when they played the SG intervention as compared to the estimated treatment effect of the total group of participants.

Similarly, fast re-orienting saccadic eye movements are also inaccurate and more variable in both endpoint and timing. Atypical gaze and attention are among the earliest symptoms observed in ASD. Disruption of these foundation skills critically affects the development of higher level cognitive and social behavior. We propose that interventions aimed at these early deficits  that support social and cognitive skills will be broadly effective. We conducted  a pilot clinical trial designed to demonstrate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of using gaze-contingent video games for low-cost in-home training of attention and eye movement. Eight adolescents with ASD participated in an 8-week  training, with pre-, mid- and post-testing of eye movement and attention control. Six of the eight adolescents completed the 8 weeks of training and all six showed improvement in attention (orienting, disengagement) and eye movement control or both. All game systems remained intact for the duration of training and all participants could use the system independently. We delivered a robust, low-cost, gaze-contingent game system for home use that, in our pilot training sample, improved the attention orienting and eye movement performance of adolescent participants in 8 weeks of training. We are currently conducting a clinical trial to replicate these results and to examine what, if any, aspects of training transfer to more real-world tasks. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

RESULTS: After 10 weeks, participants in group 1 compared to group 2 achieved significantly greater improvements on the primary outcome of time management skills (parent-reported; P=.004) and on secondary outcomes of the social skill of responsibility (parent-reported; P=.04), and working memory (parent-reported; P=.02). Parents and teachers reported that total social skills improved over time within groups,  whereas effects on total social skills and teacher-reported planning/organizing skills were nonsignificant between groups. Within group 1, positive effects were  maintained or further improved in the last 10 weeks of the study. Participants in group 2, who played the serious game during the second period of the study (weeks 10 to 20), improved on comparable domains of daily life functioning over time. CONCLUSIONS: Plan-It Commander offers an effective therapeutic approach as an adjunct intervention to traditional therapeutic ADHD approaches that improve functional outcomes in daily life.

Theory suggests that this is due to an elevated sensitivity of basic  threat circuitry implicated in retaliation (amygdala/periaqueductal gray) in youths with DBD and low levels of callous-unemotional traits and dysfunctional regulatory activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in youths with DBD irrespective of callous-unemotional traits. METHOD: A total of 56 youths 10-18 years of age (23 of them female) participated in the study: 30 youths with DBD, divided by median split into groups with high and low levels of callous-unemotional traits, and 26 healthy youths. All participants completed an  ultimatum game task during functional MRI. RESULTS: Relative to the other groups, youths with DBD and low levels of callous-unemotional traits showed greater increases in activation of basic threat circuitry when punishing others and dysfunctional down-regulation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex during retaliation. Relative to healthy youths, all youths with DBD showed reduced amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex connectivity during high provocation. Ventromedial prefrontal cortex responsiveness and ventromedial prefrontal cortex-amygdala connectivity were related to patients' retaliatory propensity (behavioral responses during the task) and parent-reported reactive aggression. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest differences in the underlying neurobiology of maladaptive reactive aggression in youths with DBD who have relatively low levels of callous-unemotional traits. Youths with DBD and low callous-unemotional traits alone showed significantly greater threat responses during retaliation relative to comparison subjects. These data also suggest that ventromedial prefrontal cortex-amygdala connectivity is critical for regulating retaliation/reactive aggression and, when dysfunctional, contributes to reactive aggression, independent of level of callous-unemotional traits.",diagnosis support,0.0,0

The present study aimed to investigate underlying neural activity of reactive aggression in children with ADHD and comorbid DBD using functional neuroimaging techniques (fMRI). METHOD: Eighteen boys with ADHD (age 9-14 years, 10 subjects with comorbid DBD) and 18 healthy controls were administered a modified fMRI-based version of the 'Point Subtraction Aggression Game' to elicit reactive aggressive behaviour. Trials consisted of an 'aggression phase' (punishment for a fictitious opponent) and an  'outcome phase' (presentation of the trial outcome). RESULTS: During the aggression phase, higher aggressive responses of control children were accompanied by higher activation of the ventral anterior cingulate cortex and the temporoparietal junction. Patients displayed inverted results. During the outcome phase, comparison between groups and conditions showed differential activation in the dorsal striatum and bilateral insular when subjects gained points. Losing points was accompanied by differential activation of regions belonging to the insula and the middle temporal sulcus.

There is an urgent need for effective interventions, but  in spite of the increasing research focus on computerized cognitive training, this has not been studied in ASD. Hence, we investigated two EF training conditions in children with ASD. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, children with ASD (n = 121, 8-12 years, IQ > 80) were randomly assigned to an adaptive working memory (WM) training, an adaptive cognitive flexibility-training, or a non-adaptive control training (mock-training). Braingame Brian, a computerized EF-training with game-elements, was used. Outcome measures (pretraining, post-training, and 6-week-follow-up) were near-transfer to trained EFs, far-transfer to other EFs (sustained attention and inhibition), and  parent's ratings of daily life EFs, social behavior, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-behavior, and quality of life. RESULTS: Attrition-rate was 26%. Children in all conditions who completed the training improved in WM, cognitive flexibility, attention, and on parent's ratings, but not in inhibition. There were no significant differential intervention effects, although children in the WM condition showed a trend toward improvement on near-transfer WM and ADHD-behavior, and children in the cognitive flexibility condition showed a trend toward improvement on near-transfer flexibility. CONCLUSION: Although children in the WM condition tended to improve more in WM and ADHD-behavior, the lack of differential improvement on most outcome measures, the absence of a clear effect of the adaptive training compared to the mock-training, and the high attrition rate suggest that the training in its present form is probably not suitable for children with ASD.",diagnosis support,0.25434836515639947,1

It is not clear, however, whether the same is also true for children. The current study investigated whether, like adults, 5-year-olds and 10-year-olds are more likely to place their trust in partners that look trustworthy than those that look untrustworthy. A second, closely related question was whether children also  explicitly value the information from face cues when making trust decisions. We investigated these questions using Token Quest: an economic trust game that gave  participants the opportunity to make investments with a series of partners who might (or might not) repay their trust with large returns. These interactions occurred under different conditions, including one in which participants were shown the face of each partner and another in which they could 'purchase' access  to faces with a portion of their investment capital. Results indicated that, like adults, 10-year-old children selectively placed their trust in those partners they perceived as looking trustworthy and many were willing to 'pay' to purchase  access to these face cues during the trust game. We observed a similar profile of trust behaviour in 5-year-olds, with no significant group difference in the impact of face cues on behaviour across the three age groups. Together, these findings indicate that the influence of face cues on trust behaviour emerges early, and highlight a capacity for sophisticated social cognition in young children.",diagnosis support,0.16297070388607462,0

Participants played the mini-Ultimatum Game as a responder while in the MRI scanner. Participants rejected unfair offers significantly less when the other player had 'no alternative' compared with a 'fair' alternative, suggesting that they took the intentions of the other player  into account. However, this effect was reduced in the juvenile delinquents. The neuroimaging results revealed that juvenile delinquents showed less activation in the temporal parietal junction (TPJ) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). However, the groups showed similar activation levels in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the right anterior insula (AI) when norms were violated.

METHODS: Study participants included 51 5-9-year-old children with frequent, impairing outbursts (probands) and 24 non-referred controls without outbursts. Parents completed a lifetime clinical interview about their child, and rated their child's current mood and behavior. Teachers completed a behavior rating scale. To assess emotion regulation, children were administered the Balloons Game, which assesses emotion  expressivity in response to frustration, under demands of high and low regulation. Parental lifetime diagnoses were ascertained in blind clinical interviews. RESULTS: No child had bipolar disorder, bipolar disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), or major depression (MDD). The most prevalent disorder was oppositional defiant disorder (88.2%), followed by attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (74.5%), anxiety disorders (49.0%), and  non-MDD depressive disorders (33.3%). Eleven probands (21.6%) met criteria for severe mood dysregulation. During the Balloons Game, when there were no demands for self-regulation, children with severe outbursts showed reduced positive expressivity, and also showed significant deficits in controlling negative facial expressions when asked to do so. Anxiety disorders were the only diagnoses significantly elevated in probands' mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, young children with severe temper outbursts do not present with bipolar disorder. Rather, disruptive behavior disorders with anxiety and depressive mood are common. In children with severe outbursts, deficits in regulating emotional facial expressions may reflect deficits controlling negative affect. This work represents a first step towards elucidating mechanisms underlying severe outbursts in young children.",diagnosis support,0.3046689574550994,1

We further investigated if cognitive capacity and motor impairment influenced game performance. Nineteen children with neurological gait disorders (mean age: 13.4 y, 42% girls) participated. To quantify game participation, electromyographic muscle activity (M. rectus femoris) and heart rate were compared in a demanding part and a less demanding part of the game. Cognitive capacity was assessed with the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence (TONI-4). Furthermore, the Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM), Manual Muscle Tests and a therapist-derived score of how well the child was able to train were assessed. Results showed that muscle activity and heart rate were higher during the demanding part of the game (30.7 +/- 22.6 muV; 129.4 +/- 15.7 bpm) compared to the less demanding part (16.0 +/- 13.4 muV; 124.1 +/- 15.9 bpm; p<0.01 for both measures). Game performance correlated moderately with the TONI-4 (r=0.50, p=0.04) and the cognition subscale of the WeeFIM (rho=0.59, p=0.01). The therapist-derived score correlated significantly with game performance (p=0.75, p<0.01) and the ability to modify muscle activity to the demands of the game (p=-0.72, p<0.01). Receiver operating  characteristic analyses revealed that the latter factor differentiated well between those children suitable for the game and those not. We conclude that children with neurological gait disorders are able to modify their activity to the demands of the VR-scenario.

METHODS: Participants included parents  of boys (aged 8-18) with ASD (n = 56), ADHD (n = 44), or TD (n = 41). Questionnaires assessed daily hours of video game use, in-room video game access, video game genres, problematic video game use, ASD symptoms, and ADHD symptoms. RESULTS: Boys with ASD spent more time than did boys with TD playing video games  (2.1 vs 1.2 h/d). Both the ASD and ADHD groups had greater in-room video game access and greater problematic video game use than the TD group. Multivariate models showed that inattentive symptoms predicted problematic game use for both the ASD and ADHD groups; and preferences for role-playing games predicted problematic game use in the ASD group only. CONCLUSIONS: Boys with ASD spend much more time playing video games than do boys with TD, and boys with ASD and ADHD are at greater risk for problematic video game use than are boys with TD. Inattentive symptoms, in particular, were strongly associated with problematic video game use for both groups, and role-playing game preferences may be an additional risk factor for problematic video game use among children with ASD.

The test is widely used clinically, but in its current format, is an under-exploited means of addressing some candidate processes, such as temporal ordering and frequency discrimination, which might be affected in APD. Here we describe a computer-based version of an auditory pattern perception test, the BirdSong Game, which was designed to be an engaging research tool for use with school-aged children. METHODS: In this study, 128 children aged 6-10 with normal peripheral hearing were tested. The BirdSong Game application was used to administer auditory sequential pattern tests, via a touch-screen presentation and response interface. A conditioning step was included prior to testing, in order to ensure that participants were able to adequately discriminate between the test tones, and reliably describe the difference using their own vocabulary. Responses were collected either verbally or manually, by having participants press cartoon images on the touch-screen in the appropriate sequence. The data was examined for age, gender and response mode differences. RESULTS: Findings on the auditory tests indicated a significant maturational effect across the age range studied, with no difference between response modes or gender.

Joint attention abilities in autism are pervasively atypical, correlate with development of language and social abilities, and discriminate children with autism from other developmental disorders. Despite the importance of these behaviors, the neural correlates of joint attention in individuals with autism remain unclear. This paucity of data is likely due to the inherent challenge of acquiring data during  a real-time social interaction. We used a novel experimental set-up in which participants engaged with an experimenter in an interactive face-to-face joint attention game during fMRI data acquisition. Both initiating and responding to joint attention behaviors were examined as well as a solo attention (SA) control  condition.

Significant differences were found between groups within social-cognitive brain regions, including dorsal medial prefrontal  cortex (dMPFC) and right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), during the RJA as compared to SA conditions. Region-of-interest analyses revealed a lack of  signal differentiation between joint attention and control conditions within left pSTS and dMPFC in individuals with ASD. Within the pSTS, this lack of differentiation was characterized by reduced activation during joint attention and relative hyper-activation during SA.

Self-report measures of substance use (alcohol, tobacco and cannabis), problematic gambling (South Oaks Gambling Screen - Revised for Adolescents, SOGS-RA), problematic computer gaming (Video Game Dependency Scale, KFN-CSAS-II), and of twelve different personality characteristics were obtained. RESULTS: Analyses revealed positive correlations between tobacco, alcohol and cannabis use and a smaller positive correlation between problematic gambling and problematic computer gaming. Problematic computer gaming co-occurred only with cannabis use,  whereas problematic gambling was associated with all three types of substance use. Multivariate multilevel analyses showed differential patterns of personality characteristics. High impulsivity was the only personality characteristic associated with all five addictive behaviours. Depression and extraversion were specific to substance users. Four personality characteristics were specifically associated with problematic computer gaming: irritability/aggression, social anxiety, ADHD, and low self-esteem.

Moreover, although externalizing behavior problems in youth are associated with deficits in reward processing and social cognition,  a real-life social interaction paradigm using functional neuroimaging (fMRI) has  not yet been applied to probe reward processing in such youth. Functional neuroimaging was used to examine the neural correlates of reward-related decision-making during a trust task in two samples of age-matched 11 to 16-year-old boys: with (n = 10) and without (n = 10) externalizing behavior problems. The task required subjects to decide whether to share or keep monetary  rewards from partners they themselves identified during a real-life peer sociometric procedure as interpersonally aggressive or kind (vs. neutral). Results supported the notion that prior social and moral information (reputations) modulated reward responses in the adolescent brain. Moreover, boys  with externalizing problems showed differential activation in the bilateral insula during the decision phase of the game as well as the caudate and anterior  insula during the outcome phase of the game. Similar activation in adolescents in response to reward related stimuli as found in adults suggests some developmental continuity in corticostriatal circuits.

When a child is referred to a health professional with normal hearing and unexplained difficulties in listening, or associated delays in language or literacy development, they should ideally be assessed with a combination of psychoacoustic (AP) tests, suitable for children and for use in a  clinic, together with cognitive tests to measure attention, working memory, IQ, and language skills. Such a detailed examination needs to be relatively short and within the technical capability of any suitably qualified professional. Current tests for the presence of AP deficits tend to be poorly constructed and inadequately validated within the normal population. They have little or no reference to the presenting symptoms of the child, and typically include a linguistic component. Poor performance may thus reflect problems with language rather than with AP. To assist in the assessment of children with listening difficulties, pediatric audiologists need a single, standardized child-appropriate test battery based on the use of language-free stimuli. We present the IMAP test battery which was developed at the MRC Institute of Hearing Research to supplement tests currently used to investigate cases of suspected AP  deficits. IMAP assesses a range of relevant auditory and cognitive skills and takes about one hour to complete. It has been standardized in 1500 normally-hearing children from across the UK, aged 6-11 years. Since its development, it has been successfully used in a number of large scale studies both in the UK and the USA. IMAP provides measures for separating out sensory from cognitive contributions to hearing. It further limits confounds due to procedural effects by presenting tests in a child-friendly game-format. Stimulus-generation, management of test protocols and control of test presentation is mediated by the IHR-STAR software platform. This provides a standardized methodology for a range of applications and ensures replicable procedures across testers. IHR-STAR provides a flexible, user-programmable environment that currently has additional applications for hearing screening, mapping cochlear implant electrodes, and academic research or teaching.",diagnosis support,0.10627369017676859,0
158,Television and video game exposure and the development of attention problems.,2010 Aug,"Swing EL, Gentile DA, Anderson CA, Walsh DA",Pediatrics,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2009-1508,"OBJECTIVES: Television viewing has been associated with greater subsequent attention problems in children. Few studies have examined the possibility of a similar association between video games and attention problems, and none of these has used a longitudinal design. METHODS: A sample of 1323 middle childhood participants were assessed during a 13-month period by parent- and child-reported television and video game exposure as well as teacher-reported attention problems. Another sample of 210 late adolescent/early adult participants provided self-reports of television exposure, video game exposure, and attention problems. RESULTS: Exposure to television and video games was associated with greater attention problems. The association of television and video games to attention problems in the middle childhood sample remained significant when earlier attention problems and gender were statistically controlled. The associations of  screen media and attention problems were similar across media type (television or video games) and age (middle childhood or late adolescent/early adult). CONCLUSIONS: Viewing television and playing video games each are associated with  increased subsequent attention problems in childhood. It seems that a similar association among television, video games, and attention problems exists in late  adolescence and early adulthood. Research on potential risk factors for attention problems should be expanded to include video games in addition to television.",diagnosis support,0.3827269828899359,1

Stimulants such as methylphenidate (MPH), given to treat ADHD, and video game play have been found to increase synaptic dopamine. We hypothesized that MPH treatment would reduce Internet use in subjects with co-occurring ADHD and Internet video game addictions. METHODS: Sixty-two children (52 males and 10 females), drug-naive, diagnosed with ADHD, and Internet video game players, participated in this study. At the beginning of the study and after 8 weeks of treatment with Concerta (OROS methylphenidate HCl, Seoul, Korea), participants were assessed with Young's Internet Addiction Scale, Korean version  (YIAS-K), Korean DuPaul's ADHD Rating Scale, and the Visual Continuous Performance Test. Their Internet usage time was also recorded. RESULTS: After 8 weeks of treatment, the YIAS-K scores and Internet usage times were significantly reduced. The changes in the YIAS-K scores between the baseline and 8-week assessments were positively correlated with the changes in total and inattention  scores from the Korean DuPaul's ADHD Rating Scale, as well as omission errors from the Visual Continuous Performance Test. There was also a significant difference in the number of omission errors among non-Internet-addicted, mildly Internet addicted, and severely Internet addicted participants. DISCUSSION: We suggest that Internet video game playing might be a means of self-medication for  children with ADHD. In addition, we cautiously suggest that MPH might be evaluated as a potential treatment of Internet addiction.",diagnosis support,0.3479400616387403,1

Although deficiencies in autonomic responding among boys with oppositional defiant disorder and/or conduct disorder are well documented, it remains unclear whether such findings extend to girls or apply only to children with aggressive forms of conduct problems. METHOD: Electrodermal responding, cardiac pre-ejection period, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia were recorded while boys (n = 110; 53 with conduct problems, 57 controls) and girls (n = 65; 33 with conduct problems, 32 controls) between the ages of 8 and 12 sat for an extended baseline, then played a game with conditions of reward and frustrative nonreward. RESULTS: Both sex effects and aggression effects were found. Aggressive boys with conduct problems demonstrated reduced autonomic functioning, consistent with previous research. In contrast, aggressive girls with conduct problems exhibited greater electrodermal responding than controls, with no differences in cardiovascular reactivity to incentives.

The apparent inversion was specific for translation motion: Rotation and expansion motion were perceived correctly, with normal sensitivity. It was also specific for random-dot patterns, not occurring with gratings. For the one patient that we were able to test extensively, contrast sensitivity for static stimuli was normal, but was very low for direction discrimination at high spatial frequencies and all temporal frequencies. His optokinetic nystagmus movements were normal but he was unable to track a single translating target, indicating a  perceptual origin of the tracking deficit. The severe deficit for motion perception was also evident in the seminatural situation of a driving simulation  video game. The perceptual deficit for translational motion was reinforced by functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. Translational motion elicited no response in the MT complex, although it did produce a strong response in many visual areas when contrasted with blank stimuli. However, radial and rotational motion produced a normal pattern of activation in a subregion of the MT complex.  These data reinforce the existent evidence for independent cortical processing for translational, and circular or radial flow motion, and further suggest that the two systems have different vulnerability and plasticity to prenatal damage. They also highlight the complexity of visual motion perception, and how the delicate balance of neural activity can lead to paradoxical effects such as consistent misperception of the direction of motion. We advance a possible explanation of a reduced spatial sampling of the motion stimuli and report a simple model that simulates well the experimental results.",diagnosis support,0.0,0

AIMS: Children's responses to a computerized grammatical training program were evaluated to consider whether repeated responding to spoken sentences with variable semantic content and the same syntactic structure would lead to consistent and fluent comprehension. METHODS & PROCEDURES: Children with receptive language impairments aged from 8 to 13 years were randomly assigned to  three groups: Group S (n = 12) responded to reversible sentences in a computerized game, using speech stimuli with pauses before critical phrases. Group M (n = 12) had the same stimuli acoustically modified to lengthen and amplify dynamic portions of the signal. Group U (n = 9) was an untrained control  group. On average, children in groups S and M completed over 1000 training trials, focusing on training comprehension of reversible sentences. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: Although responses speeded up over the course of training, and most children performed well above chance, accuracy typically remained below 95% correct for constructions such as above/below and reversible active/passive. Trained groups did not differ from untrained children on language or auditory outcomes. There was no evidence that acoustically modified speech input enhanced  comprehension. CONCLUSIONS: Rote training of comprehension of reversible sentences does not seem to be an effective approach to remediating such problems. For most children, the pattern of performance suggested that the problem was not  a lack of syntactic knowledge, bur rather limited processing capacity that led to failures of on-line computation of meaning.",diagnosis support,0.24797194374579337,1

Detailed evidence is given from a micro-analytic study of videos of monozygotic twin girls at 11 months, one of whom became autistic in the second year. Changes in this twin's attention, motor tonus, initiative and emotion reduce her prospective control of movements and her anticipations in awareness compared to her sister. These changes were reflected in the child's asynchronous  social behaviour, which frustrated the father's attempts to support her attempts  to walk, share toys, or play a game, confusing his anticipations, and this further reduced mutual attention and joint activity. Observations of the development of girls with Rett syndrome in the first year reveal changes in motor coordination, attention and communicative initiative, indicative of a failure of  intrinsic core brain regulations of neural development and conscious activity. Notwithstanding that the two conditions show clear differences in both brain growth and early development of skills and sociability, the first signs of autism and Rett syndrome have important similarities. We conclude with recommendations for an approach to early diagnosis and treatment, applicable for the whole range  of developmental brain disorders, including Rett syndrome and autism, that attempts to identify residual capacities for sympathetic motivation and collaborative learning-an approach that deliberately tries to support weakened rhythmic impulses for motor, perceptual and communicative functions in the growing infant brain.",diagnosis support,0.0,0

The need for multiple doses produces problems  with medication administration during school and after-school hours, and therefore with compliance. Previous long-acting stimulants and preparations have  shown effects equivalent to twice-daily dosing of MPH. This study tests the efficacy and duration of action, in natural and laboratory settings, of an extended-release MPH preparation designed to last 12 hours and therefore be equivalent to 3-times-daily dosing. METHODS: Sixty-eight children with ADHD, 6 to 12 years old, participated in a within-subject, double-blind comparison of placebo, immediate-release (IR) MPH 3 times a day (tid), and Concerta, a once-daily MPH formulation. Three dosing levels of medication were used: 5 mg IR  MPH tid/18 mg Concerta once a day (qd); 10 mg IR MPH tid/36 mg Concerta qd; and 15 mg IR MPH tid/54 mg Concerta qd. All children were currently medicated with MPH at enrollment, and each child's dose level was based on that child's MPH dosing before the study. The doses of Concerta were selected to be comparable to  the daily doses of MPH that each child received. To achieve the ascending rate of MPH delivery determined by initial investigations to provide the necessary continuous coverage, Concerta doses were 20% higher on a daily basis than a comparable tid regimen of IR MPH. Children received each medication condition for 7 days. The investigation was conducted in the context of a background clinical behavioral intervention in both the natural environment and the laboratory setting. Parents received behavioral parent training and teachers were taught to  establish a school-home daily report card (DRC). A DRC is a list of individual target behaviors that represent a child's most salient areas of impairment. Teachers set daily goals for each child's impairment targets, and parents provided rewards at home for goal attainment. Each weekday, teachers completed the DRC, and it was used as a dependent measure of individualized medication response. Teachers and parents also completed weekly standardized ratings of behavior and treatment effectiveness. To evaluate the time course of medication effects, children spent 12 hours in a laboratory setting on Saturdays and medication effects were measured using procedures and methods adapted from our summer treatment program. Measures of classroom behavior and academic productivity/accuracy were taken in a laboratory classroom setting during which children completed independent math and reading worksheets. Measures of social behavior were taken in structured, small-group board game settings and unstructured recess settings. Measures included behavior frequency counts, academic problems completed and accuracy, independent observations, teacher and counselor ratings, and individualized behavioral target goals. Reports of adverse events, sleep quality, and appetite were collected. RESULTS: On virtually all measures in all settings, both drug conditions were significantly different from  placebo, and the 2 drugs were not different from each other. In children's regular school settings, both medications improved behavior as measured by teacher ratings and individualized target behaviors (the DRC); these effects were seen into the evening as measured by parent ratings. In the laboratory setting, effects of Concerta were equivalent to tid MPH and lasted at least through 12 hours after dosing. Concerta was significantly superior to tid MPH on 2 parent rating scores, and when asked, more parents preferred Concerta than preferred tid IR MPH or placebo. Side effects on children's sleep and appetite were similar for the 2 preparations. In the lab setting, both medications improved productivity and accuracy on arithmetic seatwork assignments, disruptive and on-task behavior, and classroom rule following. Both medications improved children's rule following and negative behavior in small group board games, as well as in unstructured recess settings. Individual target behaviors also showed significant improvement  with medication across domains in the laboratory setting. Children's behavior across settings deteriorated across the laboratory day, and the primary effect of medication was to prevent this deterioration as the day wore on. Results support  the use of background behavioral treatment in clinical trials of stimulant medication, and illustrate the utility of a measure of individualized daily target goals (ie, the DRC) as an objective measure of medication response in both the laboratory and natural school settings. CONCLUSION: This investigation clearly supports the efficacy of the Concerta long-acting formulation of MPH for  parents who desire to have medication benefits for their child throughout the day and early evening.

METHODS: EEG was recorded from 14 children (9-15 years old) as they played a video game, watched another person playing a video-game, and sat quietly with their eyes open. Seven of the subjects had been clinically diagnosed with seizure disorders, three of whom had also exhibited photosensitivity. RESULTS: Three spectral components of the EEG showed cognitive load-related modulation. The amplitude of  a frontal midline theta (6-7 Hz) signal increased with video-game play relative to the watching and eyes open resting conditions. A posterior alpha band (9-12 Hz) signal was attenuated during the playing and the watching conditions relative to the resting condition. A central mu (10-13 Hz) rhythm was attenuated during the game-playing condition. No significant differences were found between the patient and control groups for any of these features. Incidence of epileptiform events did not discriminate test conditions in the children with epilepsy.

A two-component schedule of reinforcement was used to deliver trinkets or coins as reinforcers in a game-like test. One component was marked by a signal. During this period reinforcers (coins or trinkets) were delivered every 30 s. This component is called a 30-s fixed interval (FI) schedule of reinforcement and measures changes in reactivity to reinforcers. The other component was in effect when the signal was turned off. Then no reinforcer was ever delivered. This is called an extinction (EXT) component and measures primarily sustained attention. The ADHD children gradually developed hyperactivity to a large extent consisting of bursts of responses with  short interresponse times (IRTs) during both schedule components. The response bursts not only constituted a substantial portion of the ADHD overactivity, but may well be a key component of the behaviour commonly described as impulsiveness, the key behavioural characteristic of ADHD. In addition, the ADHD children showed behaviour during the extinction component that may well be described as a sustained-attention deficit: initially stopping when the signal was turned off and then resuming responding some time thereafter as if the signal had been turned on again. The comparison group ceased responding during extinction and did not show impulsiveness. The findings were in accordance with a steeper and shorter delay gradient in ADHD.",diagnosis support,0.08572744340925999,0

Phase 3 was  a return to the IND contingencies. The results showed that sequence variability was higher in the sequence variability (VARY) phase than in the preceding IND phase, but remained high when the contingencies returned to IND, thus replicating previous findings.

CONCLUSIONS: In addition to formal thought disorder and discourse deficits, schizophrenic children underutilize self-initiated repair when presenting their thoughts to the listener, particularly if they are being treated with neuroleptics, a potential sign of increased clinical morbidity. Impoverished communication skills might reflect negative signs in childhood-onset schizophrenia.",diagnosis support,0.24797194374579337,1

METHOD: We collected EPELI data, conventional neuropsychological task data, and parent-ratings of executive problems and symptoms in 38 ADHD children and 38 typically developing controls. RESULTS: EPELI showed predictive validity as the ADHD group exhibited higher percentage of irrelevant actions reflecting lower attentional-executive efficacy and more controller movements and total game actions, both indicative of hyperactivity-impulsivity. Further, the five combined EPELI measures showed excellent discriminant validity (area under curve 88 %), while the correlations of the EPELI efficacy measure with parent-rated executive  problems (r = .57) and ADHD symptoms (r = .55) pointed to its concurrent validity.

To examine the potential of a nonverbal battery in early identification of cognitive problems in alcohol-exposed children, 291 prospectively identified Ukrainian children were evaluated using a test battery focusing on early executive functioning (EF) and visuospatial skills, areas of cognitive development particularly sensitive to PAE in older children. Tests included the Differential  Ability Scales, 2(nd) Edition (DAS-2) and several NEPSY/NEPSY-II subtests, standardized in the United States. Others were adapted from commonly used non-standardized neuropsychological measures of EF (Preschool Spatial Span, Imitation Hand Game, A not B, Delayed Attention, Subject Ordered Pointing). Children in two sites in Ukraine, Rivne and Khmelnitsky, were tested at 3 (1/2)-4 (1/2) years to identify effects of PAE. Although most children performed within the average range, Alcohol-Exposed preschoolers had lower scores on DAS-II Summary Scores as well as on specific subtests. To evaluate the effects of alcohol dose during the pre-pregnancy recognition period and during mid-gestation of pregnancy, generalized linear regression models were used controlling for demographic and individual variables. In addition to DAS-II variables, measures reflecting sustained attention, working memory and ability to shift cognitive set were impacted by alcohol dose. Early executive function appears to subsume these  performance differences. In conclusion, findings indicate that the effects of PAE can be identified in the preschool period and reliably measured using tests assessing nonverbal and spatial skills supported by executive functioning.",screening tests,0.0,0

The distance to the gap is recorded for each jump. To evaluate the proposed game, an experiment was conducted in which 32 children diagnosed with ADHD participated. For each participant, the median and interquartile range of these distances were calculated, along with the number of omissions. Experimental results showed a significant correlation between the participants' inattention (measured by the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms and Normal Behavior rating scale (SWAN) inattention subscale) with each of these three measures. In addition to its accuracy, other benefits are its short duration and the possibility of being run on both standard computers and mobile devices. These characteristics facilitate its acceptance in clinical environments or even its telematic use. The obtained results, together with the characteristics of the video game, make it an excellent tool to support clinicians in the diagnosis of ADHD.",screening tests,0.6842105263157895,1

Whether IGD should be regarded as a disorder and, if so, how it should be defined and thresholded have generated considerable debate. METHODS: In the current study, machine learning was used, based on regional and interregional brain features. Resting-state data from 374 subjects (including 148 IGD subjects with DSM-5 scores >/=5 and 93 IGD subjects with DSM-5 scores >/=6) were collected, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was employed to classify IGD from recreational game use (RGU) subjects based on regional brain features (ReHo) and communication between brain regions (functional connectivity; FC). Permutation tests were used to assess classifier performance. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that when using DSM-5 scores >/=5 as the inclusion criteria  for IGD subjects, MVPA could not differentiate IGD subjects from RGU, whether based on ReHo or FC features or by using different templates. MVPA could differentiate IGD subjects from RGU better than expected by chance when using DSM-5 scores >/=6 with both ReHo and FC features. The brain regions involved in the default mode network and executive control network and the cerebellum exhibited high discriminative power during classification. DISCUSSION: The current findings challenge the current IGD diagnostic criteria thresholding proposed in the DSM-5, suggesting that more stringent criteria may be needed for  diagnosing IGD. The findings suggest that brain regions involved in the default mode network and executive control network relate importantly to the core criteria for IGD.",screening tests,0.5789473684210527,1

METHOD: 20 participants with 22q11.2DS aged between 6 and 14 were included in the study as well as 22 typically developing individuals (TDC) aged 6-12. To measure prospective memory, participants were asked to play a driving game (the Dresden Cruiser). This time-based prospective memory task required children to remember to refuel their car when the fuel level was low by pressing  a refuel button while driving. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Participants with 22q11.2DS remembered less often to refuel the car. Furthermore, participants with 22q11.2DS checked the fuel gage significantly less often than the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with 22q11.2DS therefore demonstrate difficulties completing a time-based prospective memory task.

Many reports have suggested that symptoms of AD/HD are related to frontal lobe dysfunctions, particularly disinhibition. However, measuring neurological findings with biomarkers during frontal functional tasks has sometimes been difficult in children with AD/HD. This study aimed to investigate frontal inhibitory function objectively in children with AD/HD during ""rock, paper, scissors"" (RPS) tasks, as a familiar game for Japanese children, using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eighteen children  with AD/HD were compared with 27 typically developing children (TDC). Children from each group were divided into two age groups: younger, 6-10years; and older,  11-16years. Changes in oxygenated hemoglobin [oxy-Hb] were measured in the prefrontal region using NIRS during a 'to lose' RPS task, in which subjects were  asked to present the RPS signal that would lose in response to one of the three signals displayed randomly on a computer screen every 2.0s. RESULTS: The rate of  correct performance with both TDC and AD/HD increased with age. Only in the older group, the rate of correct performance was significantly higher with TDC than with AD/HD. However, children with AD/HD in both age groups showed significantly  lower [oxy-Hb] activity in the prefrontal region during the 'to lose' RPS task, particularly in the dorsolateral area. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that prefrontal region activation during the 'to lose' RPS task could offer a biomarker for diagnosing AD/HD, and may help in the early treatment of AD/HD.",screening tests,0.0,0

The test is widely used clinically, but in its current format, is an under-exploited means of addressing some candidate processes, such as temporal ordering and frequency discrimination, which might be affected in APD. Here we describe a computer-based version of an auditory pattern perception test, the BirdSong Game, which was designed to be an engaging research tool for use with school-aged children. METHODS: In this study, 128 children aged 6-10 with normal peripheral hearing were tested. The BirdSong Game application was used to administer auditory sequential pattern tests, via a touch-screen presentation and response interface. A conditioning step was included prior to testing, in order to ensure that participants were able to adequately discriminate between the test tones, and reliably describe the difference using their own vocabulary. Responses were collected either verbally or manually, by having participants press cartoon images on the touch-screen in the appropriate sequence. The data was examined for age, gender and response mode differences. RESULTS: Findings on the auditory tests indicated a significant maturational effect across the age range studied, with no difference between response modes or gender. CONCLUSIONS: The BirdSong Game is sensitive to maturational changes in auditory sequencing ability, and the computer-based design of the test has several advantages which make it a potentially useful clinical and research tool.",screening tests,0.10526315789473684,0

The study of attentional bias and response inhibition, characteristic for addictive disorders, is relevant to the ongoing discussion on whether problematic gaming should be classified as an addictive disorder. METHODS: We tested the relation between self-reported levels of problem gaming and two behavioral domains: attentional bias and response inhibition. Ninety-two male adolescents performed two attentional bias tasks (addiction-Stroop, dot-probe) and a behavioral inhibition task (go/no-go). Self-reported problem gaming was measured by the game addiction scale, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-fourth edition criteria for pathological gambling and time spent on computer and/or video games. RESULTS: Male adolescents with higher levels of self-reported problem gaming displayed signs of error-related attentional bias to game cues. Higher levels of problem gaming were also related to more errors on response inhibition, but only when game cues were presented. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are in line with the findings of attentional bias reported in clinically recognized addictive disorders, such as substance dependence and pathological gambling, and contribute to the discussion on the proposed concept of ""Addiction and Related Disorders"" (which may include non-substance-related addictive behaviors) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-fourth edition.",screening tests,1.0,1
190,Making sense of listening: the IMAP test battery.,2010 Oct 11,"Barry JG, Ferguson MA, Moore DR",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Video-Audio Media",None,https://doi.org/10.3791/2139,"The ability to hear is only the first step towards making sense of the range of information contained in an auditory signal. Of equal importance are the abilities to extract and use the information encoded in the auditory signal. We refer to these as listening skills (or auditory processing AP). Deficits in these skills are associated with delayed language and literacy development, though the  nature of the relevant deficits and their causal connection with these delays is  hotly debated. When a child is referred to a health professional with normal hearing and unexplained difficulties in listening, or associated delays in language or literacy development, they should ideally be assessed with a combination of psychoacoustic (AP) tests, suitable for children and for use in a  clinic, together with cognitive tests to measure attention, working memory, IQ, and language skills. Such a detailed examination needs to be relatively short and within the technical capability of any suitably qualified professional. Current tests for the presence of AP deficits tend to be poorly constructed and inadequately validated within the normal population. They have little or no reference to the presenting symptoms of the child, and typically include a linguistic component. Poor performance may thus reflect problems with language rather than with AP. To assist in the assessment of children with listening difficulties, pediatric audiologists need a single, standardized child-appropriate test battery based on the use of language-free stimuli. We present the IMAP test battery which was developed at the MRC Institute of Hearing Research to supplement tests currently used to investigate cases of suspected AP  deficits. IMAP assesses a range of relevant auditory and cognitive skills and takes about one hour to complete. It has been standardized in 1500 normally-hearing children from across the UK, aged 6-11 years. Since its development, it has been successfully used in a number of large scale studies both in the UK and the USA. IMAP provides measures for separating out sensory from cognitive contributions to hearing. It further limits confounds due to procedural effects by presenting tests in a child-friendly game-format. Stimulus-generation, management of test protocols and control of test presentation is mediated by the IHR-STAR software platform. This provides a standardized methodology for a range of applications and ensures replicable procedures across testers. IHR-STAR provides a flexible, user-programmable environment that currently has additional applications for hearing screening, mapping cochlear implant electrodes, and academic research or teaching.",screening tests,0.0,0

The aim of the present study was to assess the levels of stress and stress mitigation in healthy school children (HSC), in children with cystic fibrosis (CF), general anxiety (GA) and attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: Each investigated group (HSC, CF, GA, ADHD) consisted of 30 school-aged children from both sexes. Psychological characteristics were evaluated on Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ). The lie scale was used to determine participant honesty. Four biofeedback  games using a pulls detector were applied for assessment of the stress levels as  well as to evaluate ability to relax. RESULTS: EPQ found more psychopathological  traits (P < 0.001) and less extroversion (P < 0.001) in children with GA and ADHD. In addition, high neurotic tendencies were found in children with CF (P < 0.01) and GA (P < 0.01). Unexpectedly, the lie scale was lower in ADHD children (P < 0.01) than in all other groups (HSC, CF, GA). The Magic blocks score was significantly different in relaxation levels between control and CF children (P < 0.05). Speed in the game Canal was significantly different in relaxation levels between healthy controls and all other groups, but no changes in pulls, as a relaxation measure, were found during the game. The CF group had much more commissions stemming from impulsivity (t= 5.71, P < 0.01), while the GA and ADHD  children had more inattention omissions (P < 0.05). Strong negative correlation between age and pulls (r= 0.49, P= 0.003) and strong negative correlation between age and omissions (r=-0.86, P= 0.029) were found among all groups analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to learn stress mediation is correlated with age. All three groups of children had significantly lower relaxation levels when compared  to healthy controls. Relaxation was more difficult for children with GA or ADHD,  and easier for children with CF.",screening tests,0.3684210526315789,1
